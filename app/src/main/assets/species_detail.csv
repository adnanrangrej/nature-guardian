175221,"<em>Syzygium rama-varmae</em> is a small evergreen tree up to 15 m high distributed in seven locations in the tropical submontane evergreen forest of Munnar, Agasthyamalai and Kanyakumari hills of southern Western Ghats. The species occupies in a narrow altitudinal range of 1,100–1,500 m elevation in its habitat associated with characteristic tree associations of the representing vegetation, usually along submontane streams and swamps. More than 50% of its population had been subjected to heavy degradation due to tea, <em>Eucalyptus </em>and wattle plantations and dams. It is inferred that there has been a total population reduction of at least 40% over three generations. Habitat fragmentation, forest fire and consumption for firewood are the major threats. The entire population is only 400 individuals, with the largest subpopulation with only 115 mature individuals. The area of occupancy (AOO) is 32 km<sup>2</sup> and the extent of occurrence (EOO) is 2,757 km<sup>2</sup>. Site specific species monitoring and recovery plans along with local awareness is recommended. Hence, the species assessed here as Endangered.","The species occurs in two protected areas, Agasthyamalai and Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, where it is represented with its three out of the seven subpopulations. The other four subpopulations are within the hills of Munnar region and need more conservation actions.","<p><em>Syzygium rama-varmae </em>is a small evergreen tree up to 15 m high seen on the montane evergreen vegetation (1,100–1,500 m) along seven hill tops in the Munnar, Agasthyamalai, Kanyakumari ecoregions of the Southern Western Ghats. The tree is located along streams or swamps in the hill tops associated with <em>Antidesma montanum, Cullenia exarillata, Palaquium ellipticum, Litsea bourdillonii, Mesua ferrea, Syzygium gardneri </em>and&#160;<em>Garcinia pushpangadaniana </em>(Irwin 2006, Shareef <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;</p>","<p>It is a small tree with a maximum recorded girth of 172 cm and an average of less than 100 cm.

61985348,"Himalayan Mayapple (<em>Podophyllum hexandrum</em>) is a perennial rhizomatous plant distributed in the alpine regions of Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The species is overexploited for its rhizomes which are highly valued in cancer treatment and other medicinal purposes. The species reaches maturity after five to seven years of growth. Flowering and fruiting in the species are erratic and regeneration is poor. At most localities, the species is rare and has a low population density. Extensive harvesting is a serious concern for its survival. The species is also threatened due to habitat loss, deforestation, and climate change. Its subpopulations have decreased significantly and a decline of at least 50% of the population over the course of the last 21 years (three generations) is suspected as a result of excessive harvest. As demand for the species on medicinal markets remains high, these population declines are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at a comparable rate. In addition, the species is likely to be negatively impacted by climate change with habitat suitability models suggesting that substantial portions of the species' range may become unsuitable by 2050. The species is listed as Endangered under criteria A2bd+3cd+4cd. Additional studies on the rate of population decline, market trends, and interventions promoting sustainable cultivation of the species are urgently needed.","India has banned the export of specimens of Himalayan Mayapple since April 1984. The export of species and its derivatives and extracts obtained from the wild is prohibited under Schedule 2-Appendix 2 of Export and Import Policy 1997–2002 (Bhardwaj <em>et al</em>. 2019). To check its illegal trade, the species has been listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES 2021). Propagation/cultivation protocols, control of illegal trade, and an integrated approach involving local communities in sustainable harvest are needed for its conservation.","Himalayan Mayapple is an erect, succulent perennial herb, about 15–60 cm tall bearing alternate, long-stalked, often purple-spotted round leaves in groups of one to three. Flowers are large, cup-shaped, bisexual, actinomorphic, gamosepalous, and white or pink coloured. The fruit is a berry with numerous seeds. Reproductive shoots of the species have two, exceptionally three, leaves whereas vegetative shoots bear a single leaf (Airi <em>et al</em>. 1997). The species prefers to grow in shady and moist sub-alpine forest floors, forest openings/margins, and alpine slopes (Airi <em>et al</em>. 1997, Xiong <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is a slow-growing plant with poor seedling survival.&#160;The species requires five to seven years to reach an economically viable size (Singh <em>et al</em>. 2021). The longevity of the species is not well established. A generation length of five to seven years is considered reasonable for determining conservation status of the species. Additional research on the life history traits of the species is likely to result in increases to this figure.","Himalayan Mayapple was introduced as a part of Western medical traditions in 1787 and used as a medicinal source in the Pharmacological Department of the USA from 1820 (Bisht and Chauhan 2016). The roots and rhizomes of the species are valued in the traditional Indian and Chinese systems of medicine. Although the species contains several bioactive constituents, the primary pharmacologically important compound is podophyllotoxin which has anti-cancer activity (Paul <em>et al</em>. 2013). This compound is used in the synthesis of etoposide and teniposide that have been demonstrated as effective in the treatment of lung cancer, leukaemias, and other tumours (Woerdenbag <em>et al</em>. 1990). In folk medicine, it is used to cure ulcers, cuts, wounds, and skin diseases (Negi <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>Data on the trade of the species is species are fragmentary and appears non-reliable. Before the ban of its export from India in 1984, 8-15 metric tons of the rhizomes and roots were exported annually from India to the USA and European countries. About 37.3 tonnes of rhizomes of Himalayan Mayapple were uprooted from Himachal Pradesh, India between 1995 and 2000 (Chaurasia <em>et al</em>. 2012). Recent estimates from India show annual trade of about 10–50 metric tons (Goraya <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The species is widely sold and grown as an ornamental plant (mostly from artificially propagated sources).","The species is threatened due to destructive harvesting, high trade value, restricted distribution, low population density, poor natural regeneration, habitat fragmentation, low genetic diversity, and lack of cultivation protocols (Kala 2005, Maqbool 2011,&#160;Rana and Samant 2011, Banerjee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Nag <em>et al</em>. 2020). Excessive harvest has been identified as the primary threat to the species, particularly in the Western Himalayas (Chaurasia <em>et al</em>. 2012, Chaudhari and Bibi&#160;2021). As demand continues to exceed available supply (Chaurasia <em>et al</em>. 2012), prices for the species are expected to remain high. There is currently no indication that existing prohibitions on collection of wild plants are adequate to address continuing population declines, and harvest levels are expected to remain at an unsustainably high level.<br/><br/>The impact of climate change on the species is not well understood, but it is likely to cause shifts in distribution or population declines. Given that temperatures during the coldest quarter of the year are the strongest predictor of Himalayan Mayapple presence (Banerjee <em>et al</em>. 2017), and that the winter temperatures have been rising more rapidly than average annual temperature increases (Telwala <em>et al</em>. 2013), the species may be especially sensitive to the impacts of climate change. In Nepal, modelling suggests that 74% of the species' habitat will become unsuitable for the species by 2050 (Shrestha <em>et al</em>. 2022).","A global estimate of the Himalayan Mayapple population is not available. Subpopulations tend to be small in size (40–700 plants per locality) and declining every year (Airi <em>et al</em>. 1997, Bhadula <em>et al</em>. 1996). The density of species in Uttarakhand, India ranged from 0.3–4.8 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> (Chandra <em>et al</em>. 2021). Airi <em>et al</em>. (1997) estimated its population from three catchments (Pindari, Sunderdhunga, and Kaphani) of Kumaun Himalaya involving 11 subpopulations and reported its density to vary from 0.50–8.23 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>. The species exhibits poor density even in the protected areas of the Indian Himalayas. Kala (2005) reported its density to vary from 0.72, 0.98, and 2 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Valley of Flowers National Park, and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary respectively. In the Nanda Devi biosphere, Western Himalaya, the density of the species ranged from 0.22–0.47 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> (Negi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Though density data for the species appear fragmentary, most reports on the population structure of Himalayan Mayapple have raised concern about population decline.&#160;<br/>The species was collected in large quantities from the wild since the British period in India, but precise documentation of its indiscriminate exploitation was documented for the first time by Shah and Kapoor (1978). A substantial portion of the export market in the 1980s was linked to European countries (Husain 1983). A 1997 Conservation and Management Plan (CAMP) workshop designated the species as Critically Endangered (Zoos’ Print 1998). Population declines have been noted in much of the species' range, particularly the western Himalayas (Chaudhari and Yamin Bibi 2021). Its subpopulations have decreased significantly since the late 1990s based on trade figures (Shah 2006) and a decline of at least 50% of the population is suspected over the the last 21 years (three generations). It is suspected that declines of a similar magnitude will occur over the course of the next 21 years as a result of the combined impacts of excessive harvest and climate change."

There is an ongoing loss of natural habitats due to anthropogenic disturbance over much of the Western Ghats. This is caused by the development of roads and road widening (India Red List Assessment Workshop September 2020), small-scale plantations, illegal encroachment and unsustainable harvesting of tree species. In addition to causing habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;small-scale plantations, the change from coffee to ginger crops is causing the opening up of the habitat (India Red List Assessment Workshop September 2020). The conversion of land to any plantation results in the removal of the understorey vegetation, and traditional farming practices (Soppinabetta) in the area causes the removal of leaf-litter, which disturbs breeding activity and destroys breeding sites (India Red List Assessment Workshop September 2020). The unsustainable harvesting of kokum trees (<em>Garcinia</em> sps.) and illegal encroachment of cash crop plantations, which are extending in size on an annual basis, are causing further habitat loss in the species' range (India Red List Assessment Workshop September 2020).<br/><br/>In the Anamalai Mountain Range, the conversion of forest to large-scale cash crop plantations (e.g., cardamom) is a major threat, along with water abstraction and diversion used for irrigation in these plantations (K. Vasudevan and V. Sankaraman pers. comm. September 2020). The presence of plantations alongside the forest will increase edge effects and cause the drying out of this species' habitat (K.

22693431,"Recent monitoring data have shown that this widely distributed species has probably declined by 30-49% over the past three generations (15 years). The exact causes of declines are unknown, but are likely to include habitat loss and degradation (particularly on stopover and wintering grounds) and climate change impacts (particularly affecting breeding productivity), as well as disturbance and hunting.","<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>This species is not listed on the annexes of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive, but is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU. It is listed on Annex II (strictly protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex II of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 374 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for the conservation of this species on passage and in winter (EUNIS 2024). It is designated as a priority species for international conservation measures by the AMBI CAFF program of the Arctic Council. Concentrations of the species when breeding and on migrations are protected in the Ust-Lensky (Yakutia) and Daursky (Chita oblast) nature reserves, the Novosibirsk Islands federal nature reserve, and a number of regional protected areas in Yakutia. It is federally listed as Critically Endangered in Australia due to rapid population declines. Some habitats along flyway routes are protected. Active management is also underway at some Australian sites to combat cord grass invasion, as well as protective measures implemented to reduce disturbance at roost sites (Clemens <em>et al</em>. 2020).The Australasian Wader Studies Group, along with BirdLife Australia's Shorebirds 2020 Project and committed volunteers continue to monitor migratory shorebirds within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Vine and Maurer 2016). China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of <em>Spartina </em>cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including <em>C. ferruginea</em>) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016). North Korea became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and Southeast Asian countries:&#160; Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by <em>C</em>. <em>ferruginea&#160;</em>on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and&#160; leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organisations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct research to better understand the species' dependence on key migratory staging sites, and increase knowledge of the impacts of disturbance (Anon. 2015). Protect remaining intertidal habitats across the species' range (including the Yellow Sea) to prevent further habitat loss and degradation (Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Anon. 2015), and work with governments along the East Asian – Australasian Flyway to prevent destruction of key migratory staging sites (Anon. 2015). Manage important sites to reduce the impact of disturbance (Anon. 2015). Continue and expand monitoring schemes. Raise awareness of the species. Incorporate requirements for this species and others into coastal planning (Anon. 2015). Develop climate change adaptation plans and strategies (Clemens <em>et al</em>. 2020). Implement protection of Australian non-breeding habitats, involve indigenous owners in management of local land, and protect stopover sites (Clemens <em>et al</em>. 2020).","This species breeds on slightly elevated areas in the lowlands of the high Arctic especially on southward-facing slopes, as well as along the coast and islands of the Arctic Ocean&#160;(Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). It shows a preference for open tundra with marshy, boggy depressions and pools (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Lappo <em>et al. </em>2012) from melting permafrost and snow (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;The nest is a cup positioned on the margins of marshes or pools, on the slopes of hummock tundra, or on dry patches in&#160;<em>Polygonum</em>&#160;tundra (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). Breeding success can vary year to year, with prime years yielding a higher number of juveniles (Australian BirdLife 2017). The Victorian Wader Study Group and Australasian Wader Studies Group for example recorded a higher percentage of juveniles (c. 48%) during 2016-2017 (Australian BirdLife 2017). In the winter the species chiefly occurs on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal mud- and sand-flats, estuaries, saltmarshes (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), exposed coral, rocky shores and tidewrack on sandy beaches (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986), and also inland on the muddy edges of marshes, large rivers and lakes (both saline and freshwater), irrigated land, flooded areas (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996), dams (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986) and saltpans (Khomenko 2006). Abnormal rainfall in inland sites may additionally create temporary wetlands that provide additional suitable habitat (Geering <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dhanjal-Adams <em>et al</em>. 2018). On the breeding grounds the diet of this species consists mainly of insects, such as the adults, pupae and larva of Diptera (e.g. midges, craneflies (Johnsgard 1981)) and beetles, as well as bugs and leeches (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;In the winter its diet consists of polychaete worms, molluscs, crustaceans (such as amphipods, brine shrimps and copepods), and occasionally insects and seeds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>1996). It is a full migrant, moving long distances by well-travelled routes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","Hunting is a probable threat to this species, as the hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g., Gallo-Cajiao <em>et al</em>. 2020, Yong <em>et al</em>. 2022). The extent of hunting in the Arabian Peninsula region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species was recorded in one of the seven trade datasets evaluated by Donald <em>et al. </em>(2024).","On the breeding grounds, breeding success of this species is apparently strongly correlated with lemming cycles (Underhill 1987, Summers <em>et al</em>. 1998) and it has been suggested (e.g. de Fouw <em>et al</em>. 2018) that recent falling numbers may be a reflection of collapsing lemming cycles, probably driven by climate change in the Arctic (Wauchope&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Moreover, climate change has been identified for several shorebird species as a threat that is driving reduced breeding productivity by a number of mechanisms (e.g.&#160;Meltofte <em>et al.</em> 2007, Eikelenboom 2016, Kubelka<em> et al</em>. 2018); more research for this species specifically is needed.<br/><br/>The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. At Barr Al Hikman, Oman, where up to 9% of the Asian-East African Flyway has been reported to overwinter, planned urban developments, the aquaculture (for shrimp) industry, oil refineries and disturbance from fishing industries and falcon hunting were all identified as threats by de Fouw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018) and these almost certainly apply to other important staging and wintering sites in the broader region. The extent of hunting in this region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). Rapid land use change and loss of mudflats are also major threats here (S. Jarwade&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). It is also threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2005). This species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007) and avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.<br/>Significant numbers of&#160;<em>C. ferruginea&#160;</em>migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. Astonishingly, the extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (Murray <em>et al</em>. 2014, IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak around 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continue to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien&#160;<em>Spartina alterniflora&#160;</em>cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; since 2020 this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the follows as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao <em>et al</em>. 2020).","Populations breeding in Western Siberia and wintering in West Africa are estimated to total are estimated to number 300,000-400,000 birds, while those breeding in Central Siberia and wintering in south-west Asia, East and southern Africa probably total an additional <em>c</em>.400,000 (van Roomen <em>et al</em>. 2022). A further 200,000 birds are estimated wintering in South Asia, although this may be an overestimate. The East Asian-Australasian Flyway population was estimated to be&#160;<em>c</em>.90,000 in 2016 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2022; Mundkur and Langendoen 2022), but has probably declined sharply since then. In total, the global population size is estimated at <em>c</em>.990,000-1,090,000 birds. To account for considerable uncertainty in the calculations of these estimates (with added uncertainty on the extent to which populations have declined since they were made), the total global population is placed in broad bracket of 700,000-1,200,000 birds. Approximately 60-80% are suspected to be mature individuals, leaving a population of 420,000-960,000 mature individuals."

186884431,"<em>Pecteilis triflora</em> has been recorded from Bangladesh, northern India and Nepal. However, there has been no recollection of this species from Bangladesh for over a century and it is considered to be Possible Extinct there. Subpopulations have been found recently at one site in the upper Deccan Plateau, central India (Jharkhand) and at two sites in the Western Himalaya (Uttarakhand). For the purpose of this assessment, the subpopulations in Nepal are inferred to be extant as they are relatively recent. The population occurs as disjunct subpopulations, however, the two subpopulations in the Western Himalaya are close and the subpopulation in Central India is observed to contain juvenile plants, pointing towards natural recruitment. At the known localities in India, the three subpopulations occur within a <em>Shorea robusta</em> (Dipterocarpaceae) dominated forests, on hill slopes. This points towards habitat specificity of the species. The four subpopulations generate an EOO of 178,950 km<sup>2</sup> and an AOO of 16 km<sup>2</sup>. In Central India, the habitat is disturbed because it is traversed by a narrow road, where there is a plan to construct a highway. In the Western Himalaya, the habitat is threatened by the logging of trees for fuelwood. Hence, there is a degradation in the quality of habitat. The four subpopulations are considered as four locations. Each known Indian subpopulation contains around 30-40 mature individuals. Overall population size is not known however, the overall population is inferred to contain less than 250 mature individuals. There is inferred loss of plants in Bangladesh but it can be assumed to be historical. There is an inferred continuing decline in the number of mature individuals due to the degradation of habitat.

215199522,"<em>Lepidagathis clavata</em> is a perennial herb, stenoendemic to the state of Maharashtra and Karnataka in India. It grows on exposed rock surfaces on lateritic plateaus. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 37 km<sup>2</sup> and the area of occupancy is 12 km<sup>2</sup>. The species has 2 subpopulations spread over 3 locations. Genetic transfer between the two subpopulations seems extremely unlikely and the population of&#160;<em>Lepidagathis clavata</em>&#160;is considered here as severely fragmented. There is a continuing decline in the quality of habitat because of local fires and trampling, change in land-use due to quarrying and residential area. The species also faces a potential threat in future due to infrastructure and industrial development proposed in the region. The species is assessed here as Critically Endangered B1ab(iii). It also satisfies the thresholds for EN B2ab(iii).",There are no conservation actions in-place specifically for this species.,"<em>Lepidagathis clavata</em> occurs on open lateritic plateaus at elevations of 810–850 m. On lateritic plateaus it is restricted to exposed rock surfaces with some sloping areas. It is a perennial species, which flowers in the post-monsoon season i.e. November onwards and remains till April. This species is very specific to its microhabitat (exposed rock surfaces). Seeds are covered with hairs which help them to stick to the rocky surfaces and prevent them being washed away. Regular field observation carried out from 2016 to 2023 indicate that flowering is irregular. Even though it is perennial, it does not flower every year. However, more studies and observations are required to establish flowering cycle for each population.",No use of this species is known.,The species is severely threatened by local fires and trampling. Both lead to decline in the quality of habitat. Lateritic plateaus in this region face a threat of quarrying and land use change due to residential and tourism areas. It was observed that some insects eat the inflorescence but its effect on flowering and fruiting is not known.,"<em>Lepidagathis clavata</em> grows in patches on exposed rock surfaces on lateritic plateaus at elevations higher than 800 m asl.&#160;<br/>There are two subpopulations: i) Chaukul plateau in&#160; Sindhudurg District of Maharashtra and ii) Chorla-sada plateau in Belgaum district of Karnataka. The subpopulations are small, spread over a restricted area and are at a distance of more than 20 km from each other. The species is restricted to the lateritic plateaus which are naturally separated by a valley and landscape covered with shrubland vegetation. Apart from this there are anthropogenic factors such as road construction, presence of residential area which have led to altered landscape. A large water reservoir has been constructed in the past decade in the river valley separating these two subpopulations.&#160;The subpopulations are isolated and their flowering was not synchronous as per our field observations. Hence, genetic transfer between the two subpopulations seems extremely unlikely and the population of <em>Lepidagathis clavata</em> is considered here as severely fragmented."
22679012,"Very poorly known species with no confirmed record since 1932 (although an unconfirmed observation was made from Dibru-Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary in March 1998, followed by another sighting in Manas National Park, Assam, in 2006).

If surveys for the species continue to be unsuccessful, extinction probability analysis may become appropriate.<br/><p></p>","Poorly known (see BirdLife International 2001 for review). A probable resident, it inhabits damp grassland, particularly stands of tall grass, and sometimes bogs and swamps, and is recorded in vegetation up to 3 m (but potentially up to 5 m) tall <strong></strong>(A. Choudhury <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>2006), from the foothills up to <em>c</em>.1,000 m. Historical records indicate that it was generally encountered in small groups of 4-12, and was shy, reluctant to fly and extremely difficult to observe, although coveys were occasionally seen feeding in the open on recently burnt ground. The little available data indicate that it breeds between January and May. <p></p>",Unknown. Historically was hunted (it is from this practice that most records/specimens are known: BirdLife International [2001]) and this continues within its former range in Manipur/Nagaland (A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2024); however the extent to which this is still impacting this species is wholly unknown given the absence of recent sightings or knowledge of its contemporary distribution.,"Drainage and destruction of tall grasslands to meet the demands of an expanding human population have been extensive in Manipur and Bangladesh at least, presumably greatly reducing and fragmenting available habitat (BirdLife International 2001, Rahmani 2016). Any extensive patches of tall grass that might remain in Bangladesh are inundated for two-thirds of the year and are thus unlikely to support significant populations. Livestock grazing poses a threat throughout its range. An inappropriate fire regime coincides with the species' breeding season (A. Rahmani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012); grass in the protected areas of Assam and northern W Bengal is burnt annually as part of management, potentially restricting available habitat for grassland specialist birds and increasing the risk of predation (A. Choudhury <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2016). Its habit of running in tightly-knit groups when fleeing disturbance made it easy to kill several birds with a single shot, a factor likely to have contributed to its decline, in conjunction with a dramatic rise in hunting levels during the 20th century; while hunting rarely occurs in Assam (particularly within the protected area network which is most likely to host a remaining population of this species), hunting does occur in Manipur and Nagaland (A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2024). Its habitat at Mornoi, Assam, which was a major site of specimen collection in the past, has now been replaced by tea plantations (A. Choudhury <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).  <p></p>","Very poorly known, but any remaining population must now be very small. It was described historically as local, but not very rare, although even by the 1930s it was documented as declining in Manipur and there has not been a confirmed record since 1932 (BirdLife International 2001). An unconfirmed observation was made from Dibru-Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary in March 1998, followed by another sighting in Manas National Park, Assam, in 2006&#160;<strong></strong>(Choudhury 2006). <br/><br/>In Manipur and Nagaland there have been few recent surveys, but very little suitable habitat remains and hunting is an ongoing tradition in these states with no evidence of this species being captured (as might reasonably be expected given it was evidently hunted quite commonly historically [BirdLife International 2001]). In Assam, where the species is considered most likely to persist (A. Rahmani and Praveen J <em>in litt</em>. 2024), surveys of numerous sites for other grassland species (e.g. Rahmani 2016) have failed to find it, and it is unclear whether management of the many tiger reserves in this region provides adequate habitat for this species (owing to uncertainty on its requirements). Notably, <em>Synoicus chinensis </em>is still dedicated frequently in north-east India, despite also having detectability that is at least ostensibly similar.&#160;This pattern of effort suggests that any remaining population of this species is probably now very small, placed here in a band of 1-200 mature individuals. Comprehensive surveys dedicated to this species are urgently needed."
22679330,"This species has a relatively small range that extends from western Myanmar to south-west China and northernmost Thailand. Within it, fewer than 10,000 mature individuals may remain, and evidence suggests it is continuing to decline in response to habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, as well as compounding impacts of hunting. Accordingly, it is listed as Vulnerable.","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. The species is legally protected in India, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Populations persist in several protected areas, but these have very low coverage of total suitable habitat (see review by Savini <em>et al</em>. 2021).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Survey sites throughout its range to determine both presence/absence, and (where relevant) density. In particular, re-surveying sites covered by previous effort, e.g., Choudhury (2009), would be a reliable indicator of population trend. Increasing the area of this species' range circumscribed by protected areas is a priority, as is ensuring existing protected areas are sufficiently resourced to safeguard this species (and others) from habitat loss and hunting. Choudhury (2009) recommended that awareness campaigns amongst rural communities are carried out.","It inhabits open, dry, subtropical evergreen (mainly oak), coniferous (chiefly pine) or mixed conifer-broadleaf forests on steep, often rocky hillsides interrupted by scrub and grassy clearings. It appears to favour broken or successional habitats, with adjacent patches of dense forest, and fire may play an important role <strong></strong>(G. Gale <em>in litt.</em> 2005). Although in Ailaoshan Nature Reserve the species prefers broadleaved evergreen forest (Liu Zhao<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. (2008). It is also described as inhabiting secondary and degraded jungle, and frequents the edges of abandoned slash-and-burn cultivation (Choudhury 2009). On Dazhong Mountain,Yunnan, the species' foraging habitats have been shown to be very similar in spring and autumn (Wei Zhou<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2010). Roosts are often located along ridges, and in other relatively open areas <strong></strong>(Iamsiri and Gale 2004). The species has been observed to feed on oak nuts and termites <strong></strong>(Iamsiri and Gale 2004). A recent microscopic analysis of faecal samples collected in Dazhongshan Nature Reserve, Yunnan, found the species' winter diet there to include at least 18 plant species of 12 families, with a clear preference for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Athyrium guangnanense</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pseudocystopteris spinulosa</span> (Li Ning <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). <br/><p></p>","The species is caught by snares set for galliformes, and is usually killed for consumption, or traded for consumption, although many trapped birds will be lost to predators (Choudhury 2009).&#160;In 2001, Choudhury (2002) found a bird for sale in Mizoram that was suspected to have been collected in Myanmar, suggesting there is international movements of this species.","The principal threats to this species are habitat loss and degradation, and hunting. Savini&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2021) estimated a c.19% contraction in suitable habitat between 2000 and 2018, while Global Forest Watch (2022) indicate similar losses of c.17-20% forest loss over three generations (c.18 years; Bird&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020) between 2002 and 2021. The species is caught by snares set for galliformes, and is usually killed for consumption, or traded for consumption, although many trapped birds will be lost to predators (Choudhury 2009). Extensive shifting cultivation and uncontrolled annual burning has resulted in substantial fragmentation and loss of suitable habitat in Myanmar, China and India. In north Thailand, it has suffered from agricultural intensification and habitat fragmentation resulting from development projects (such as the construction of roads [Choudhury 2009]), and reforestation of large areas with dense conifer plantations may also pose a threat. In parts of north-eastern India, the majority of the rural population practice slash-and-burn cultivation as their main occupation, thus very rapid human population growth and expansion threaten to worsen its impacts (Choudhury 2009). Road construction also facilitates increases in the prevalence of hunting and logging (Choudhury 2009).&#160;Only c.2% of this species' range lies in protected areas (Savini&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021) and consequently both habitat loss and hunting are predicted to continue apace without adequate safeguards.","Estimating the population size of this species is difficult due to the inaccessibility of much of its range. The population of nominate <em>humiae </em>was previously suspected to number only 1,000 birds (McGowan and Garson 1995), however based on surveys covering Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, Choudhury (2002) estimated the population in India was likely to be c.4,000 individuals. A further c.6,000 individuals were thought to occur in north and east Myanmar (G. Gale and A. Iamsiri <em>in litt</em>. 2005). The population in China is unknown but based on densities at some key sites (see Lu Taichun 1991, Li Xiangtao 1996) the population probably numbers a further 4,000-5,000. The population in north-west Thailand is likely to be small and probably numbers fewer than 500 birds (BirdLife International 2001). Combining these estimates, the number of individuals is likely to be no more than c.15,000 birds, or c.10,000 mature individuals. However, the majority of these estimates were made 2000-2005 and the population has plausibly declined by 20-29% since then (see Population Trend). Consequently, the population estimate is placed in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals, with a best estimate of approximately 7,500."

31181,"<em>Buchanania barberi </em>is a small tree species endemic to Kerala, India. The species was previously only known from its type locality, but now it is only reported from along the Vamanapuram river and therefore it is estimated that there has been a decline in mature individuals. A recent survey of the Palode region, where the species was last reported, found just four trees, two juveniles and two mature individuals. As such, the species has a very small area of occupancy (AOO) of 4 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and a very small population size (two), and is only known from one location. There is a projected decline due to a lack of regeneration of the species as fruit production was low, germination was poor and seedling establishment was not reported. The remaining habitat of the species is also threatened by infrastructure development. Conservation action including planting and awareness campaigns have been carried out. The species is globally assessed as Critically Endangered.","This species is reported from one <em>ex situ </em>collection (BGCI 2022). A survey of the remaining population was carried out in 2016 by staff at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI). Seed collections were made during this survey and further research on the germination and propagation of these seeds is ongoing (Dhyani and Anilkumar 2017). During multiple efforts to reintroduce <em>B. barberi</em>, circa &gt;300 saplings were transplanted to near natural habitat in Palode. In addition, some saplings were also planted in the RET (Rare, Endangered and Threatened plants) Species Park and in the arboretum areas of JNTBGRI. After two years the plants attained an average height of 28 cm with 55% survival (Dhyani <em>et al.</em> 2023a). Awareness campaigns were conducted in schools, forest department and near natural habitat in Palode.&#160;Awareness campaigns were conducted by creating educational materials, including a poster detailing the species' status, threats, and conservation efforts. Sessions were organized in Malayalam, educating around 200 students and 50 community members about <em>B. barberi</em>&#160;in terms of importance, identification, threats, propagation, and conservation interventions. Quiz programs were also conducted and winners received awareness items. The awareness materials have been shared with the staff of international botanical organizations i.e., Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum and Botanic Gardens Conservation International, UK. A painting of <em>B. barberi</em> by Reema Abraham was showcased in the art exhibition ""The Endangered—Can Art Save Them"" by Art Impact International, USA (Dhyani <em>et al</em>. 2023b).

The tree grows in association with <em>Tabernaemontana alternifolia, Hydnocarpus pentandrus, Myxopyrum smilacifolium, Palaquium thwaitesii, Madhuca neriifolia, Piper nigrum, Dregea volubilis </em>and <em>Clidemia hitra</em> (Dhyani <em>et al.</em>&#160;2022).",There are no known uses for this species.,"This species is threatened by the development of roads and infrastructure. The original type locality of the species is thought to be lost due to the clearance of coastal forest land near Varkala (Santhosh Kumar <em>et al. </em>2002). The remaining individuals are threatened by their locality along a road which, if it were to expand, would cause the loss of these trees too (Santhosh Kumar <em>et al. </em>2002, Dhyani and Anilkumar 2017). It is also reported the remaining individuals produce few fruit, seedlings do not establish and there is slow germination and consumption of seeds by birds. All these factors reduce the regeneration potential of the species and are likely to cause further, future decline (Dhyani and Anilkumar 2017).","Prior to 2002 this species had not been recorded since 1916. Since this time four trees were found along the Vamanapuram river, but the original type location of the species had undergone deforestation and development; trees here are assumed lost (Santhosh Kumar <em>et al. </em>2002). A further survey of 11 sites in the Palode region found four individuals, two mature and two juvenile (Dhyani and Anilkumar 2017). Low seed production is reported, as is a lack of seedling establishment and seed germination, along with the predation of seed by bird. The remaining trees are found alongside a road, where expansion is a major risk to the species (Dhyani and Anilkumar 2017). Overall, the population size is anticipated to be much smaller than 50 mature individuals."

Wintering birds usually frequent estuaries, coastal mudflats and lowland swamps, and sometimes damp meadows, saltpans and rice-fields. <p></p>","Hunting and trapping are a significant threat to the species and occur significantly in several important regions for the species, including Russia (Nechaev 1989, Artukhin 2016, Tiunov 2016), China (Severinghaus and Chi 1999, Tokranov 2006), and Southeast Asia (BirdLife International 2001).","<em>T. guttifer </em>is endemic to the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF), which has the highest rate of habitat loss of any of the flyways (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species is particularly vulnerable to habitat loss as it requires specific habitats for its breeding and roosting sites (Maleko <em>et al</em>. 2021), which are limited in their extent (Pronkevich and Voronov 1990, Blokhin 1998, Yu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Habitat loss within the EAAF stems from a multitude of sources. A rapidly growing human population in Asia means that large areas of wetlands are converted to artificial agricultural wetlands (Bai <em>et al.</em> 2015), with declines in the species’ numbers expected in densely occupied areas (Thompson<em> et al. </em>1993, 2014). Even in areas of low human density (i.e., Sea of Okhost coast, Russia), human occupation is concentrated in areas preferred by the species such as deltas and estuaries (BirdLife International 2001).<br/><br/>Increasing development to support expanding cities results in the further loss and fragmentation of wetlands and coastal habitats (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012), and often requires reclamation which degrades or entirely removes suitable habitat, and has additional impacts through pollution, increased algal blooms, and changes to water salinity and sedimentation regimes (Moores <em>et al</em>. 2008). Specifically, Bangkok is now encroaching into the Inner Gulf of Thailand, a main overwintering area for the species (Round 2006, Li <em>et al. </em>2007, Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2018), reclamation of tidal flats in Saemangeum, South Korea, has depleted the small number of individuals that pass through there (Moores<em> et al. </em>2016), and the fossil-fuel extraction industry in Russia has caused the likely extirpation of the species from their northern Sakhalin breeding grounds (Nechaev 1989, Leonov 2000). The by-products of extraction activities also degrade wetland habitats, as does debris from large-scale logging (Nechaev 1989, Artukhin 2016), rubble from human settlements (Nechaev 1989, Newell 2004), and industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollutants (Barter 2002, Tong 2012, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2018). Oil spills are also a common occurrence South China and Yellow Seas, and plastic pollution is widespread, which can reduce access to important sites, be ingested, contaminate feeding sites, or ensnare animals (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). Renewable energy can also pose a threat to the species, such as the offshore wind farm in Rudong, China which displaces birds and may cause collisions (Peng <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Hunting and trapping are a significant threat to the species and occur significantly in several important regions for the species, including Russia (Nechaev 1989, Artukhin 2016, Tiunov 2016), China (Severinghaus and Chi 1999, Tokranov 2006), and Southeast Asia (BirdLife International 2001).<br/><br/>Invasive and native species also pose a threat to <em>T. guttifer</em>.<em> Spartina alterniflora</em> has rapidly spread through central Asian intertidal ecosystems (Wang <em>et al. </em>2018) and reduces foraging habitat (Yang<em> et al</em>. 2020, IUCN 2023).<br/><br/>Additional threats to the species include climate change which can cause declines due to the loss of coastal habitats through sea-level rise and/or increased natural disasters (Robarts <em>et al.</em> 2013, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2018, Yu <em>et al</em>. 2020), loss of nesting sites comprising cold-adapted vegetation (Leng <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bai <em>et al.</em> 2019, Zhang <em>et al. </em>2019), changes in fire regimes (Shvidenko and Schepaschenko 2013, Liu 2016), and altered migration patterns (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012). Further, anthropogenic disturbance in a myriad of forms (Barter 2002, Pronkevich and Voronov 2013, Artukhin 2016) and avian diseases (Maleko <em>et al</em>. 2021) also pose a threat to the species.<br/><br/>Local governments in the EAAF are resistant to designating coastal wetlands as Protected Areas as it may limit future opportunities for economic growth, and furthermore, they are often designated based on low commercial value rather than high biodiversity value (Xia <em>et al. </em>2017). With formal protection lacking in the vast majority of the species range (Maleko<em> et al. </em>2021), further habitat loss and impacts are expected.","Global population size of this species was previously estimated to number less than 1,000 birds (e.g. BirdLife International 2001) but more recent count data from its southbound migration has found this evidently to be an underestimate. Cao <em>et al</em>. (2023) revised this estimate to 1,500-2,000 birds, based on counts of at least 1,194 individuals at Tiaozini alone in September 2021, with additional birds counted at neighbouring Xiaoyangkou and Dongling taking the minimum number to <em>c</em>.1,300. They concluded that the latter total was unlikely to represent the total number of birds due to survey effort, but concluded it probably represents the majority of the global population. The estimate of 1,500-2,000 (Cao <em>et al</em>. 2023) is therefore accepted here. Because these counts are made post-breeding, it is unlikely that they all refer to mature individuals, although the percentage that are is not well known. To account for uncertainty in this calculation, 60-80% are suspected to be mature individuals, leaving a total population size of 900-1,600 mature individuals."

Should it prove to be more abundant than documented here, it may not be as at high a risk of extinction as feared; however, should it prove to be declining, it may even qualify as Critically Endangered. Future research should endeavour to answer these questions urgently.<p></p>","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>None is known, although the species' range is captured in large part by the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve (which spans more than 85% of the main island).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The most urgent action for this species is to determine whether its population size is as small as is feared. Surveys similar to Manchi <em>et al</em>. (2021), but targeting the present species, should therefore be considered a priority. It is also critical to understand this species' adaptability to forest degradation, and to investigate whether its population trend is declining. Enforcing protection in the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve will be important to safeguarding its future.","It is found in mixed evergreen forest, and is seen most frequently in the canopy (Rasmussen and Anderton 2012).<br/><p></p>",,"Increased settlement of the islands has led to increased pressure on natural resources, and planned development projects (especially to increase tourism) could severely affect the habitat of this species. Nonetheless, this is not yet apparent. In the three generations (c.24 years; Bird&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020) to 2022, forest loss in this species' range was equivalent to c.4% (using data between 2000 and 2020 and extrapolating) (per Global Forest Watch 2022, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). The habitat requirements of this species are improperly known, but it is assumed to be at least somewhat forest-dependent (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Rasmussen and Anderton 2005, 2012). However, most of the losses documented are from Great Nicobar Island, where according to satellite imagery (Google Earth 2022), clearance appears to be small-scale and undertaken by freeholders. Given the adaptability of other&#160;<em>Spilornis&#160;</em>(see summaries in Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Billerman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022), it is entirely possible that this scale of habitat degradation does not negatively impact the species, and may even benefit it.","In 2021, this species had a range that encompassed only 915 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of forest (per Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013, Global Forest Watch 2022). Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001) suggested that <em>S. cheela</em>&#160;typically occurs at densities/occupancy as sparse as one pair/100 km<sup>2</sup>, although this is patently not appropriate for this species given the frequency and spread of data (eBird 2022). Instead, a much higher density of one pair/5-6 km<sup>2</sup> (as also suggested by Ferguson-Lees and Christie [2001] for some <em>Spilornis </em>populations) would give a population size of c.305-370 mature individuals. More recently, Manchi <em>et al</em>. (2021) estimated the density of <em>S. elgini </em>(with which this species is sometimes considered conspecific) to be 4-5 birds/25 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(=0.16-0.2 birds/km<sup>2</sup>). This density estimate is considered the most reliable, since <em>S. elgini</em>&#160;is sympatric (and thus in competition with) <em>S. cheela</em>, which also applies to the present species. Notably, Manchi <em>et al</em>. (2021) found densities of 7-8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of <em>S. cheela&#160;</em>on the Andamans, suggesting that in these circumstances, the possible density of <em>Spilornis </em>species varies little. If the density recorded of <em>S. elgini </em>is true of&#160;<em>S. klossi</em>, the species would number only 150-180 mature individuals. Such a low number is broadly congruent with the (perhaps pessimistic) species-specific assessment of Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001), who wrote of <em>S. klossi&#160;</em>that a 'high density would be necessary for [the] population to reach three figures'. There is little reason to suspect that the population density <em>is</em>&#160;especially high, with Rasmussen and Anderton (2012) noting that it is 'apparently scarce' and eBird (2022) data suggesting its encounter rate is broadly similar to that of <em>S. elgini</em>. Evaluating the available data, there is high confidence in the fact that this species' population size is likely to be small and this is confirmed by people familiar with the species, who describe it as 'decidedly rare' in the southern half of Great Nicobar and suggest its density may even be lower than that of <em>S. elgini&#160;</em>(Praveen J <em>in litt</em>. 2023). The population size is here estimated to be 150-370 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 150-180 (following the data from <em>S. elgini </em>as outlined above)."

22695494,"Nicobar Sparrowhawk is a very poorly known species known definitely from only four islands in the poorly studied Nicobar archipelago.

82031633,"<p>Wherever studies have been conducted, Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin subpopulations were found to be small: always fewer than 1,000 and generally fewer than 100 individuals, in discrete or semi-isolated areas. Humpback dolphins have one of the most specific habitat preferences and restricted distributions of any marine megafauna, and both of these characteristics are well known to reduce resilience to environmental change and anthropogenic threats and to increase extinction risk (Purvis <em>et al</em>. 2000, Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins are concentrated in coastal waters within 2 km of shore and they are often sighted only a few hundred meters from land. This distribution places them in exactly the same locations as most small-scale fishing effort which is prevalent in nearshore habitat throughout their range. As a result, humpback dolphins encounter large numbers of coastal gillnets and are at a high risk of entanglement. Unsustainable mortality rates have been reported from several areas and frequent encounters with fishing gear can be inferred from the high degree of scarring and injury—for example, 41% of individuals in Pemba, Tanzania bore gear-related scars (Braulik unpub. data).<br/><br/>An emerging and increasing threat is the industrialization and development of coastlines, extensive land reclamation and the rapid expansion of ports and shipping through the Blue Economy which is converting remote coastlines to more industrialised settings with degraded, polluted, and noisy habitats. Although information on population size, threats and mortality is available only for portions of the species’ range, there is strong evidence of population declines from the majority of places with long-term datasets, and there are strong reasons to suspect and infer that the threats are or will soon become similar or even more intense elsewhere.<br/><br/>The deaths of only 4.2 individuals per year from a population of 100 Humpback Dolphins would result in a 50% decline (Moore 2015). Dramatic observed declines in studied subpopulations in South Africa, United Arab Emirates and Zanzibar, and all indications of trends elsewhere in the range, suggest that mortality rates are consistently at or above what would result in a 50% decline in 75 years (three generations). The species’ preferred habitat and small populations overlap in both space and time with several pervasive threats that are increasing in severity, leaving no refuges for these dolphins. The threats are serious enough in a large enough proportion of the total species range that a range-wide decline of at least 50% over three generations spanning both the past and the future (about 75 years, from 1960 (the start of intensive monofilament gillnetting in this region) to 2035) is suspected and inferred and the causes of the decline (bycatch and hunting [both considered here to constitute ‘exploitation’], and decline in habitat quality (and possibly pollution) have not ceased. Therefore, the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin qualifies for Endangered A4cd.<br/><br/>The factor primarily responsible for the decline is incidental mortality in small-scale coastal fisheries, but the loss, degradation and pollution of coastal habitat in numerous coastal areas is a contributing and increasing factor. The threats have not been mitigated anywhere in the species’ range, even though threat levels are increasing everywhere. All evidence suggests that threats and declines will continue and are likely to increase in the future. Worldwide there are almost no examples where cetacean bycatch in small-scale artisanal fisheries has been successfully addressed. Alternative methods for small-scale fisheries to replace gillnets are not generally available. Therefore, the species also qualifies for Endangered A3cd as a decline of over 50% can be projected to occur over the next three generations (75 years from 2022 to 2097). It also qualifies for Endangered A2cd as a decline of over 50% is suspected over the last 75 years beginning with the expansion of the use of gillnets in global marine fisheries from around the end of the Second World War up to the present day.</p>","For many countries and regions throughout their range, Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins are poorly known, and although many threats exist, very few effective conservation actions have been taken, and there is no real understanding of what needs to occur to safeguard populations. One exception is KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa where since 1999 attempts have been made to reduce the large and unsustainable accidental capture of dolphins in shark nets by using acoustic deterrents (pingers) and whale alarms (Cliff and Dudley 2011) but these have so far been unsuccessful (Atkins&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013). Nonetheless, there were changes in numbers and length of net installations deployed along the KZN coast, with a 70% reduction in the total length of netting, from 45 km in the mid-1990s to 13 km currently (Vermeulen <em>et al.</em> 2023). At Richards Bay in 2019 the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board replaced two high-catch nets with baited hooks. This is likely to reduce Humpback Dolphin mortality significantly but will not eliminate them as four shark nets remain. Acoustic pingers were also trialed on gillnets in Tanzania.<br/> <br/> Dolphins used to be hunted in Menai Bay in the south of Unguja Island, Tanzania, however since the 1990s the hunt has been replaced by swim-with-the-dolphin tourism (Berggren <em>et al</em>. 2007). Similarly, in the southwest region of Madagascar there has been a focus on community engagement to mitigate marine mammal hunting and bycatch through the establishment of community-based nature-oriented tourism, local protection and enforcement, and social outreach campaigns, that have met with some success (Cerchio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, 2014).","Throughout their range, Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins occur in coastal habitats that include mangroves, rocky reefs, coral reefs, lagoons, and shallow protected bays. The over-riding habitat preference appears to be for water shallower than 25 m in depth. In Richards Bay, South Africa all encounters with Humpback Dolphins were in water shallower than 20 m. Dolphins used the area within 2 km from shore extensively and were rarely seen more than 3 km from land (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Algoa Bay over 80% of sightings were within 400 m of the shore, average depth at sightings was 6.6 m, and there was a consistent preference for feeding near shallow rocky reefs throughout the year despite the considerable changes in dolphin abundance observed between the early 1990s and 2011 (Karczmarski <em>et al</em>. 2000, Koper <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Zanzibar, distribution of Humpback Dolphin groups was restricted to a median distance of 830 m (min–max: 200–1,550 m) from the shore and a median water depth of 11 m (min–max: 2–26 m) (Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Nosy Be, Madagascar the mean depth of sightings was 8.2 m with 95% of sightings in water less than 20 m deep (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka, India most groups were sighted in water less than 20 m deep (Sutaria and Jefferson 2004, Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2015), and similarly in the Gulf of Mannar, Kanyakumari, Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam, dolphins occurred in waters 10–25 m deep (Sutaria unpub, Sutaria 2015, Muralidharan 2018). In Oman and the Arabian Gulf, humpback dolphins generally occur in water depths of less than 20 m with an average depth recorded of 8.3 m in 31 of 34 recorded sightings (Minton 2004, Minton <em>et al</em>. 2010). In some areas, such as the Musandam Peninsula and parts of Dhofar (Oman), they occur along rocky shores with a narrow continental shelf, but in such cases they occur very close (a few hundred meters at most) from the coast. Ecological niche modelling based on citizen science data collected between 2012–2019 in the United Arab Emirates identified the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin as the species of small cetacean with the most restricted suitable habitat compared to the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin and finless porpoise. Its habitat coincides with the areas most heavily impacted by human activities associated with busy urban centres, such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi (Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2021). Humpback Dolphins regularly occur in mangrove channels within the Indus delta (Pilleri and Gihr 1972, Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015).<br/><br/>Comparison of 13 photo-id catalogues from sites around the coast of South Africa showed individual ranging distances had a median value of 120 km and varied from 30 km up to 500 km (Vermeulen <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Four photo-identified Humpback Dolphins were sighted at two different locations 170 km apart in Kenya, indicating capacity for significant movement (Mwango’mbe <em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><br/>Group size is generally smaller than 10 individuals, however large group sizes of more than 50 have been recorded off the coast of Pakistan and Oman (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kiani and Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015), Sindhudurg (Sule <em>et al</em>. 2017) and Orissa (Sutaria unpub. data).","<p>Throughout significant parts of their range, except perhaps South Africa and some parts of the Middle East, accidentally captured Humpback Dolphins are used for human consumption and other local purposes. They are reportedly eaten (termed ‘marine bushmeat’) in Madagascar (Razafindrakoto <em>et al</em>. 2004), Mozambique (Guissamulo 2008), Tanzania (Amir <em>et al</em>. 2002) and India (Kumarran 2012). The meat is sometimes used as bait for sharks (Amir <em>et al</em>. 2002) or for crabs and fish (Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015) and the oil is used in some areas as wood preservative for boats (Berggren and Coles 2009), for cooking or as medicine (Gore <em>et al</em>. 2012). A dolphin drive hunt in the southwest of Madagascar is exclusively to capture dolphins for human consumption (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). A hunt that occurred on Zanzibar killed many dolphins until the early 1990s but has now ceased. Although dolphins are often utilized, reports of actual market sales are uncommon. Humpback Dolphins were reported as being for sale at three different locations on the west coast of India (Goa, Malpe in Karnataka and Trivandrum in Kerala) (Mohan 1994, Kumarran 2012) and in Madagascar they were for sale in local villages (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Non-consumptive uses of Humpback Dolphins include dolphin-watching tourism. However, because of their low numbers and shy behaviour, they are often not the primary target of this activity.</p>","<p>The habitat preference of Humpback Dolphins for shallow waters places them in some of the world’s most intensively utilized, fished, shipped, modified and polluted waters. The primary threat to the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin throughout most, or all, of its range, is incidental mortality in fisheries (‘bycatch’), including in gillnets and in shark control nets in South Africa. The bycatch threat likely emerged in the early part of the 20th century as the use of gillnets in global marine fisheries started to expand dramatically. Global fish production increased at 3.2% per year from 1961–2009, and the increase in global landings began several decades earlier (FAO 2012). Marine mammal bycatch likely escalated with the gradual introduction of monofilament netting in the 1960s and 1970s (Klust 1973, Potter and Pawson 1991, Tarbit 1984). There are no known areas that offer a refuge for this species from the pervasive threat of incidental mortality in fisheries. Although it is impossible to evaluate the magnitude in most areas, in all areas where it has been evaluated, the rate of incidental mortality of this species in fisheries appears to be high, unsustainable and causing rapid local population declines.<br/><br/>With the exception of the KwaZulu-Natal shark control program, there have been no on-board observer studies from which bycatch estimates could be generated. In virtually all countries around the Indian Ocean, fisheries, and particularly those that operate in the near-shore areas where these dolphins occur, are small-scale and artisanal, and involve small boats or canoes, that are frequently oar- or sail-powered. The fishing effort is concentrated within the preferred near-shore habitat of Humpback Dolphins. For example in Pemba in Tanzania approximately 90% of humpback dolphins sighted during recent surveys occurred less than 1 km from shore, and 95% of recorded fishing vessels occurred in exactly the same habitat. Of 27 photo-identified humpback dolphins in the same area, 41% had clear injuries from previous entanglements in fishing nets (Braulik, unpub. data). This demonstrates the degree to which most humpback dolphins must frequently encounter fishing gear and there is every reason to believe that this example from Pemba is the norm throughout the species’ range.<br/><br/>Substantial incidental mortality of humpback dolphins in coastal gillnets is reported from most countries within their range (IWC 2002). The best-studied bycatch is for the KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, where 203 Humpback Dolphins (50% in Richard’s Bay) were captured in shark nets in the 30 years between 1980 and 2009 (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2013). This corresponds to a 4.2% annual mortality rate (Taylor supplemental spreadsheet “<em>Sousa plumbea</em> Natal.xlsx”) assuming the population is potentially able to grow at 3% per year (Moore 2015). A high proportion (8%) of 109 distinctive, catalogued individuals were recognized among the animals bycaught in shark nets between 1998 and 2006 and while individuals naturally emigrate from the Richards Bay area, this points to mortality in shark nets as a driver of the permanent loss of individuals from the area which may also be negatively affecting the wider population (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2016). The annual rate of decline, assuming that the population is growing at a maximum potential rate, would be 1.3% resulting in a 63% decline in three generations.<br/><br/>The reported mortality rate due to fisheries interactions (both bycatch and directed take) in the southwest region of Madagascar was noted to be almost certainly unsustainable (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Mozambique, intense coastal fishing effort is considered to be the main threat to Humpback Dolphins, and shark fishery gill nets and trawl nets have incidentally killed dolphins throughout the country (Guissamulo 2008).<br/><br/>Incidental catch of humpback dolphins has been documented in gillnets off the south coast of Zanzibar in Tanzania (Amir <em>et al</em>. 2002). There are currently no estimates of the magnitude of the bycatch but given that even two humpback dolphins taken per year would exceed 2% of the population, it is very likely that bycatch represents a threat to the dolphins in the area (Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006) and is one of the main factors responsible for the large observed decline in abundance (Sharpe <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In Oman, as in India, the high incidence of stranded humpback dolphins was presumed to be the result of interactions with fisheries (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2002, Sutaria unpub. data). In addition, in India, dolphins are known to tear fishing gear leading to economic losses to fishers and risk to the dolphins. In some areas, including in Sindhudurg, Maharashtra, the Gulf of Mannar, and Tamil Nadu in India, retaliatory measures like intentional killing take place. This is a frequent occurrence and a cause of concern (Jog <em>et al</em>. 2017, Muralidharan 2018). The presence of pieces of fishing gear in dolphin gut contents was observed in seven necropsies conducted in India between 2020 and 2021; and at least 20 strandings between 2016–2021 indicated evidence of interactions with fishing gear (Marine Mammal Research and Conservation Network of India October 2022).<br/><br/>There are very few areas within the known range of Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins where anthropogenic alteration of habitat has not occurred. The destruction of inshore habitats is likely to be one of the greatest threats to humpback dolphins, particularly in the southern Africa region (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2015, Plön <em>et al</em>. 2016) and in the Arabian/Persian Gulf and many other rapidly developing urban coastal areas (Karczmarski 2000, Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004). Dredging, land reclamation, construction blasting, port and harbour construction, pollution, boat traffic, oil and gas exploration and development (including inshore seismic surveys), and other coastal development activities occur, or are concentrated within, humpback dolphin habitat and threaten their survival in ways that are challenging to quantify but likely to be impactful (IWC 2002). Development of both large and small ports and the associated manufacturing and processing is expanding incredibly rapidly around the Indian Ocean rim, and the areas often selected for ports are estuaries and protected bays that are the preferred habitat of humpback dolphins (Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2015). The continued presence of Humpback Dolphins in degraded habitats does not rule out that habitat degradation has had adverse behavioural or health effects (IWC 2002, Piwetz <em>et al</em>. 2015). This is a pervasive threat that is increasing throughout the species’ range and there is no reason to expect this trend to change in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>In comparison to other marine mammals with wider and more oceanic ranges, the exposure of Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins to environmental contaminants and their bioaccumulation is likely to be very high (Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001). Many of the large urban centres and ports around the Indian Ocean, including Mumbai, Karachi, Dubai, Aden, Mombasa, Mogadishu, Dar es Salaam, Maputo and Durban, release a toxic cocktail of untreated human and industrial waste into coastal waters inhabited by Humpback Dolphins. Of six dolphin species in South Africa, Sousa plumbea was found to be the most contaminated by total Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and concentrations of DDTs in this species were among the highest levels reported in delphinids globally, above the likely effect threshold for impairment of immune function (Gui et al. 2016). Flame retardants, PBDEs and dechloranes were also found in levels as high as other industrialized countries (Aznar-Alemany et al. 2019). Elsewhere the levels and impacts of such pollution on Humpback Dolphins have yet to be studied but may be severe (Gore et al. 2012). For example, in Pakistan very high levels of chemical pollution in creeks of the Indus delta are toxic enough to cause fish kills and are likely to have adverse effects on cetaceans (Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015). In Gadani, Pakistan up to 100 ships per year are scrapped and dismantled leading to the release of large amounts of heavy metals, asbestos, dioxins and other persistent organic pollutants in coastal water. These problems are widespread and increasing in many countries; their impact on coastal dolphins has not been evaluated but pollution is likely contributing to local declines in range and abundance and may have caused extirpation adjacent to major industrial centres.<br/><br/>Other threats that appear somewhat less serious (possibly because of lack of information) or only affect a certain portion of the species’ range include direct killing, boat traffic/harassment, underwater noise, and oil spills and exploration (IWC 2002, Piwetz <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is little evidence for intense hunting of humpback dolphins except for those in Madagascar (IWC 2002); in the southwest of that country, dolphins were historically taken with harpoons but are now targeted with gillnets or in a drive hunt. Andrianarivelo (2001) estimated a minimum of 61 deaths of <em>S. plumbea</em> between 1985 and 1999 in Anakao related to directed takes including drive hunts (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Given the relatively small population sizes reported throughout the region, the reported mortality rate due to hunting is likely unsustainable and contributing to local population declines (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Dolphin hunting used to occur in Menai Bay in Zanzibar; the last hunt there occurred in 1996, taking 23 individuals, assumed to be <em>S. plumbea</em> and <em>Tursiops aduncus</em>. This would represent annual mortality of close to 12% for a combined population estimate of around 200 animals for the two dolphin species in the area. The removal rate was certainly unsustainable, resulting in a negative impact on the dolphin populations off the south coast of Zanzibar (Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006). Humpback dolphins were hunted in former years in the Arabian Gulf, and there was some evidence of continued dolphin hunting from small, motorized boats using harpoons until the early 2000s in Oman (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004), but this is now thought to have ceased. In Maputo Bay, Mozambique dolphins were also reported to be hunted for meat in intertidal shallows and estuaries (Guissamulo 2008).<br/><br/>Blast fishing using dynamite or other explosives is a considerable threat to humpback dolphins in the few countries in which it occurs frequently, including Tanzania (Cagua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2017b) and Sri Lanka (Cornelis <em>et al</em>. 2008). This illegal activity is concentrated in near-shore areas that are also specifically humpback dolphin habitat.<br/><br/>In South Africa, where the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin has been most extensively studied, it was concluded that there no single cause for the rapid decline could be identified, and that the cumulative effects of multiple stressors, which are difficult to pinpoint and mitigate, are responsible for the decline in numbers (Plön <em>et al</em>. 2021).</p>","Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin abundance has been estimated, using mark-recapture of photo-identified individuals, from several locations throughout its range. All populations that have been quantitatively evaluated have been small, always fewer than 1,000 individuals and usually fewer than 200. Current available photo-identification data in South Africa suggest national abundance is likely to be well below 1,000 individuals, possibly closer to 500 (Vermeulen&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2017). Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal has a population composed of a small core of residents (5%) along with many transients (81%) that probably range widely along the coast (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2016). Abundance in the Richards Bay area was estimated as 170 (95% CI 112–230) individuals using open population models on data collected from 1998 to 2000 (Atkins and Atkins 2002). Building on this, Johnson (2012) estimated an abundance of 203 individuals (95% CI 185–221) based on data from 1998–2005 in the same area. Abundance for the KwaZulu-Natal province was estimated as 165 (95% CI 134–229) in 1991–1992 (Durham 1994). No marked animals from Richards Bay were recorded in Algoa Bay, where Karczsmarski <em>et al</em>. (1999) estimated the total abundance at 466 (95% CI 447–485) animals during fieldwork conducted from 1991 to 1994. Populations in Plettenberg bay were estimated at about 112 (95% CI 75–133) (Jobson 2006) and in Mossel Bay as 125 individuals (95% CI 112–140) in 2011–2013 (James <em>et al</em>. 2015), although marked individuals are known to move between these areas (Vermeulen <em>et al</em>. 2017). A total of 51 marked individuals were identified in the area between False Bay and Saint Sebastian Bay (Vermeulen <em>et al. </em>2017), no abundance estimates are available at this stage.<br/><br/>Five populations have been evaluated in Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya and are estimated at approximately 100 individuals or fewer (Guissamulo and Cockcroft 1997, Guissamulo and Cockcroft 2004, Meyler <em>et al</em>. 2011, Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sharpe&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, Kasuga <em>et al.</em> 2022, Braulik unpub. data).<br/><br/>In the early 2000s, in Oman and much of the Arabian Gulf this species was amongst the most commonly recorded coastal cetacean, with large reported group sizes, frequently more than 40 individuals and up to a hundred or more (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004). The environment has deteriorated considerably since that time.&#160;Between 2014 and 2015, photo-ID surveys along the coast of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (UAE) suggested an overall population of 701 (95% CI = 473–845) individuals, from 220 photo-identified animals; the largest abundance estimate reported for a single local population of this species in the world (Lopez <em>et al</em>. 2017). Along the coast of Iran, 30 (95% CI 22–38) Humpback Dolphins were estimated to inhabit the Dayer-Nakhiloo Marine National Park (Mohensian <em>et al</em>. 2022) and 92 animals (64–131, 95% CI) were estimated using line transect methods, in Mousa Bay, Iran (Hemami <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Pilleri and Pilleri (1979) conducted limited surveys in the Indus Delta of Pakistan and based on these made an educated guess that there were approximately 500 Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins in the entire delta. During 46 survey days between 2005 and 2009 in the Indus delta, 112 sightings of this species were made. A discovery curve remained steep after 87 dolphins had been photo-identified (Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015), suggesting the population is vastly larger in that area. In Sonmiani Bay, Balochistan, Pakistan, during nine survey days in 2011–2012, 36 sightings were made and an exceptionally large group of 68 individuals was encountered (Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015).<br/><br/>Indices of abundance for Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins were recorded for the Gulf of Kachchh and the Goa coast of India, and the sighting rate was over six times higher in Goa (Sutaria and Jefferson 2004). However, opportunistic surveys suggest that distribution and density of Humpback Dolphins along the coast of Goa have declined since 2004 (Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Sindhudurg, Maharashtra, the local population size is thought to be fewer than 1,000 individuals, probably closer to 500 based on an analysis of the photo-identification catalogue (Sule <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The data presented above indicate that Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins occur in restricted habitats, are discontinuously distributed, and are not abundant anywhere in the range. There is no estimate of total species abundance, but Jefferson and Rosenbaum (2014) stated that the available estimates for specific populations suggest that range-wide abundance is probably no larger than the low tens of thousands.<br/><br/><strong>Trends in Abundance<br/></strong>There is little quantitative evidence of trends in abundance for any of the small populations across the range of the species. Consequently, trends must be inferred by evaluating the magnitude of mortality or the magnitude of declines in relative sighting rate or group size. However, in most places where data are available to assess changes over time, there are indications of significant declines in abundance, relative sighting rate and/or group size.<br/><br/>In Algoa Bay over a 16-year period, the mean Humpback Dolphin group size halved (Koper <em>et al</em>. 2016, Bouveroux <em>et al</em>. 2018). Additionally, Bouveroux <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported a decrease in sighting rates from the early 1990s, a lower re-sighting rate, and a high proportion of animals seen only once, all suggesting a decreased number of animals in Algoa Bay than previously estimated (Bouveroux <em>et al</em>. 2018). In Plettenberg Bay, abundance was estimated to have declined from 93 (95% CI 72–114) to 41 (95% CI 28–54) between 2002 and 2013 (Plön <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Madagascar between 2004 and 2013 there was an observed decline in sighting rates of Humpback Dolphins in the southwest region (off Anakao) along with a decrease in mean group size, likely as a result of hunting, bycatch and habitat degradation (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). In waters of Menai Bay off the coast of Zanzibar, abundance of an Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin population (minus calves) was estimated as 52 (95% CI 29–93) in 2002 (Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006) and as 19 (95% CI 14–25) when the same area was surveyed in 2015, 13 years later (Sharpe <em>et al</em>. 2019). This represents a 63% reduction in abundance in less than one generation.<br/><br/>In the Arabian Gulf, aerial strip transect surveys between 1986 and 1999 recorded Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins as the second most commonly sighted cetacean after <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> (Preen 2004). The data from those surveys indicated a statistically significant decline in abundance of 71% for all cetaceans observed, including Humpback Dolphins, Bottlenose Dolphins, and Finless Porpoises (Preen 2004).<br/><br/>Between 2013–2014, a 15 months-long photo-ID survey along the Dubai coastline (part of UAE) recorded Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin sightings and a total of 23 photo-identified individuals. A 15-month-long survey conducted seven years later in 2021–2022 in the same area with the same amount of effort, recorded only one sighting of the species suggesting a decrease in sightings of 87.5%. Citizen science reporting of Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin sightings in UAE waters also shows a decline in the period between 2014 to 2021. The average number of sightings/year for this species in the two sequential periods 2014–2017 and 2018–2021 decreased from 69 to 30.25, representing a decrease of 56%, whereas other regularly encountered species of small cetaceans (<em>Tursiops aduncus</em> and <em>Neophocaena phocaenoides</em>) either remained stable or increased when the two periods were compared. The main visible changes to the environment along the coastline have been land-reclamation, increased boat traffic and overall disturbance, likely reducing the suitable habitat available for the species (Natoli unpub. data).<br/><br/>Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins occur in relatively low density in a narrow band of shallow-water habitat, and the small populations cannot sustain even a moderate level of anthropogenic mortality without suffering declines. As an example, and to place this in the context of the IUCN Red List Criteria, assuming a 3% recruitment rate (Moore 2015), a discrete subpopulation of 100 individuals would decline by 30% over 75 years (three generations) if only 3.7 individuals were removed per year due to anthropogenic mortality and it would therefore qualify as Vulnerable (VU). Similarly, removal due to anthropogenic mortality of only 4.1 animals per year from such a subpopulation would result in a 50% decline over 75 years supporting an Endangered (EN) classification (see Table 5 in Moore 2015). Extrapolation from single, small, isolated subpopulations with data-based estimates of mortality or decline obviously requires consideration of whether the conditions of those subpopulations are representative of the global population. Although few quantitative data on population trends exist, because of the restricted distribution and the generally small size of subpopulations of this species, only 4–8 deaths per year in a given subpopulation of 100 individuals would be sufficient to cause a 50% decline in that subpopulation over three generations. The overwhelming level of threat due to intensive use of this species’ exclusively near-shore habitat by humans, and the consistently high reported mortality rates throughout the parts of the species’ range where monitoring has occurred, means that the global Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin population size is almost certainly decreasing (Friedmann and Daly 2004, Braulik<em> et al</em>. 2015)."
33007,"<em>Dipterocarpus alatus </em>is a large tree species. It is native to India, Bangladesh Indo-China and the Philippines. The species is used for timber. It is globally assessed as Vulnerable. The population of this species has been reduced by more than 30% over the last three generations (300 years) and this is likely to continue in the next 100 years. It is threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation for the expansion of agriculture and also due to selective logging of mature trees. The species is mostly found in protected areas within Viet Nam but it is poorly represented in <em>ex situ </em>collections. Some efforts where the species occurs have been made to conserve the species but more needs to be done. It is recommended the species habitat is protected and further information is gathered on population size and decline and the harvest and trade of the species.","The species is found in only eight&#160;<em>ex situ </em>collections (BGCI 2017), more <em>ex situ </em>collections of this species should be made. The species occurs in protected areas and is widely cultivated in plantations. The species was previously globally assessed as Endangered (1998). Within Indonesia the species is only allowed to be harvested once it has reached 50 cm diameter at breast height (Masripatin <em>et al. </em>2003). The majority of countries within its range have assessed the species to be a priority species for conservation (Luoma-aho <em>et al. </em>2003). For example within Lao PDR the species has a conservation status of B which means the species is vulnerable due to restricted habitat, heavy human impact on the habitat and significant human use of the species (Phongoudome <em>et al. </em>2003). The species is found in genetic conservation stands within Thailand (Sumantakui 2003). It is recommended that the habitat of the species be conserved and more information gathered on population size and decline. The species harvest and trade should be further monitored.","<em>Dipterocarpus alatus</em> is a large tree species growing to between 30 and 60 m in height (Singh <em>et al. </em>2014). It is found within evergreen and semi-evergreen dipterocarp forests in low-lying areas (foothills and valleys) (Singh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It is often found on ancient alluvial, granite and basalt rocks (Tam&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The species requires well drained soil and humidity. It is tolerant to flooding but not to fire and the wind (Ecocrop 1993-2007). The species is insect pollinated, sets fruit between March and April and seed is wind dispersed (Tam <em>et al. </em>2014). Its habitat is continuing to decline in area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO), and quality.","This tree is used for timber. It belongs to the genus <em>Dipterocarpus</em><em>&#160;</em>which produce commercially valuable medium hardwoods&#160;and have the trade name Keruing (Meier 2015). The wood is used for construction, plywoods and waterproofing baskets and boats. Tree resin can also be collected which is used to produce paint, varnish, lacquer (Tam <em>et al. </em>2014) and for torches and caulking boats. The tree has medicinal properties; bark can be used to make a tonic to treat rheumatic complaints and the resin can be used to treat gonorrhoea (Singh <em>et al. </em>2014). The species can be cultivated.","The main threats for the species are deforestation for agriculture, commercial tapping of resin and exploitation for timber. Where selective logging occurs the species distribution is fragmented and low in density. The species is also at risk from loss of genetic diversity and genetic introgression as many specimens along the east coast of Peninsular Thailand are hybrids between <span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. alatus</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. chartaceus.</span>","This species is widespread and is currently still fairly abundant. Trees within Viet Nam are confined to protected areas. The species has a generation length of 100 years.

22715856,"This grassland species is now likely endemic to north-east India, where it occurs at very few, widely scattered sites. Given the small total extent of suitable habitat, it is thought to have a small population size, and remaining sites are susceptible to threats which include agricultural encroachment, overgrazing and inappropriate management. Nonetheless, a relatively large part of its range is now contained within a broadly effective protected area network (although this might be ineffective at buffering some threats including climate change). It is accordingly considered Vulnerable.<p></p>","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Records from several protected areas, most notably Kaziranga NP, Dibru-Saikhowa NP and D'ering WLS, but much of its range still lies in unprotected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Conduct surveys in remaining suitable habitat, perhaps using call playback, to establish its current distribution and status. Conduct research into its habitat use and seasonal movements to clarify the relative importance of different habitats and altitudes. Extend, upgrade and link existing protected areas, and establish new ones, in order to conserve remaining tracts of natural grassland. Promote regeneration of suitable grassland habitats wherever possible. Control livestock-grazing in protected areas and regulate grassland burning (A. Choudhury <em>in litt. </em>2016) to reduce rates of tall grassland loss and degradation. Promote widespread conservation awareness initiatives focusing on sustainable management of grassland to maximise both thatch productivity for local people and available habitat for threatened grassland birds. <p></p>","It is resident in extensive reedbeds and tall grass, sometimes mixed with scrub and scattered trees, on marshy ground or adjacent to swamps and rivers, from the plains to 800 m, but mostly below 500 m. It has also been encountered in damp forest scrub. It is very inconspicuous, but has distinctive vocalisations, and is generally found in pairs or small parties, skulking on or near the ground. It breeds during the rainy season from May onwards.<p></p>",,"Main threat to this species is habitat loss and degradation. Large parts of its (small) range are now protected, but areas that are not protected (chiefly in Arunachal Pradesh) continue to be subject to encroachment of agriculture (particularly for rice paddies, mustard and tea plantations), illegal grazing, grass harvesting for thatch production, and inappropriate grassland management within protected areas (Rahmani 2016, Choudhury 2021, Rahmani&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022, Krishnan 2021). Extreme flooding events in the Brahmaputra valley, associated with rapid run-off from an increasingly denuded catchment, could damage grasslands, although some flooding may be beneficial to grassland quality. Similarly dam construction in the foothills of Arunachal Pradesh could negatively impact the species owing to changes in flow conditions (R. Das&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>","Population size not estimated but described as scarce and local (Rasmussen and Anderton 2012). Historically was probably rather abundant in grasslands along the Brahmaputra floodplains, but habitat loss over the past 150 years has been considerable and population now heavily depleted. Recent records from only a handful of sites (Krishnan 2021, SoIB 2023, eBird 2024) and less than 500 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat is estimated to remain (data from Jung <em>et al</em>. [2020], via sRedList [2023]). While a population density is not known, citizen science data indicate that even within suitable habitat it is relatively scarce and localised (although this evaluation is undoubtedly hampered by this species' low detectability when not singing). Although there are no robust data from which to estimate a population size, it is here precautionarily suspected to number 2,500-9,999 mature individuals."

The afforestation programmes with exotic tree species such as <em>Eucalyptus</em> and Black Wattle (<em>Acacia mearnsii</em>) by the forest department in the grassland continued the conversion during the 1960s and 1990s (Augustine 2018). These were equally predominant in all five landscapes of the species. Increased infrastructure development, roads, and transportation continue to be the major reasons for the conversion of habitat. The traditional seasonal fire practice by the indigenous community, once considered a threat but later identified as vital for management of the grasslands, was taken as one of the management practices of the grasslands by the forest department (Saju 2012). The frequency of controlled fire sets for managing the grasslands, prioritizing the Nilgiri Tahr (the threatened and endemic mountain goat of the habitat), needs to be studied based on the ecology of <em>Strobilanthes kunthiana</em> species and grassland and Shola forest dynamics.

22681585,"This species is listed as Vulnerable as it has suffered a rapid population decline over the past 20 years (three generations) due to loss of primary forest cover throughout much of its range.

Continue to monitor populations on the ground to better understand the  impacts of selective logging. Continue to monitor rates of forest loss,  and forest integrity, using remote sensing data. The principal action needed is the (effective) protection of remaining lowland blocks of forest, especially in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, all of which likely host a significant proportion of the global population of this species. Stop selective logging in mature stands of sal&#160;<em>Shorea robusta&#160;</em>in Himalayan foothills (Kumar and Shahabuddin 2012). Increase forest connectivity throughout its range.<br/><p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This resident species breeds between March and June in the west of its range and without a distinct season in South-East Asia (Lammertink 2004; see Kumar and Shahabuddin 2012)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is two to four eggs. Nest-hole excavation, incubation and chick-rearing are conducted by both sexes, with helpers at some nests. It forages in noisy groups of three to six individuals and sometimes more (Lammertink 2004)<strong></strong>. Groups occupy large territories. It is not a migrant, &#160;however, in areas of its distribution that show a marked seasonality (e.g. Himalayan foothills) the home range appears to expand locally during winters (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2011). <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> It occupies primary semi-open moist deciduous and tropical evergreen old growth, lower elevation forests, as well as adjacent secondary forest and clearings with scattered tall trees. It prefers dipterocarp (e.g. Shorea robusta in Himalayan foothills [R. Kumar <em>in litt. </em>2016])&#160;and teak forests in certain areas, as well as swamp-forest and tall mangroves. It is most frequent in lowlands and lower hills below 600 m, but does occur up to 1,100 m in the Himalaya and occasionally up to 2,000 m. <strong><br/>Diet </strong>Foraging groups search and exploit nests of social insects (ants, termites, and stingless bees), often in trunks and branches of old live trees. Birds may also take small fruit (Lammertink 2004)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","In most of its range, probably not used or traded. In parts, however, especially Lao PDR (where hunting pressure is extremely high), and perhaps more locally in Myanmar and Viet Nam, gun and projectile hunting is thought to have contributed to (at least historic) declines (M. Lammertink&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press).","The chief cause of rapid declines in this species has been the loss and degradation of forest within its range (Lammertink <em>et al</em>. 2009). The scale and cause of this varies in different countries, but almost nowhere in its range is totally removed from the overarching threat. In the Greater Sundas (especially lowland Borneo and Sumatra), the principal driver of forest cover loss has been the industrial-scale removal of forest, initially for timber extraction, but motivated in part or in whole by the replacement of these forested areas with large-scale plantations, especially oil-palm and rubber. More locally, this is compounded by localised shifting agriculture and timber extraction, the latter especially targeting larger, hollow-bearing trees needed by this species. The damage caused in Indochina has ostensibly been lesser, with rates of overall forest cover loss incomparable to those in the Greater Sundas (Global Forest Watch 2023); however, here selective logging and clearance for agriculture has been pervasive, rendering remaining stands of forest among the least intact in Asia (Grantham <em>et al</em>. 2020). Concerningly, this has been most acute in the deciduous dipterocarp forests in the lowlands favoured by this species, especially in Cambodia and southern Lao PDR, and in both countries rapid declines are suspected to have occurred over the last 20 years, and even by then the species' population size was only a small fraction of its historic baseline. In Lao PDR, and possibly also Myanmar and Viet Nam, gun and projectile hunting is thought to have contributed to (at least historic) declines (M. Lammertink&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Moreover, in Lao PDR, hydroelectric power plants have flooded considerable areas of lowland forest (Soukhaphon <em>et al</em>. 2021). In Myanmar, Bangladesh and parts of India, selective logging, even in nominally protected areas, continues and presumably is driving (at least slow) population declines as elsewhere in the species' range, although data are sparse. In the Himalayan foothills, clearance for sal&#160;<em>Shorea robusta&#160;</em>plantations continues and is likely driving slow declines (Kumar and Shahabuddin 2012), although these are not typically in global strongholds.","The global population size of this species was estimated by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. (2009) to lie somewhere in the broad range of 26,000 to 550,000 mature individuals, a figure derived from an initial remote-sensing based analysis which yielded an estimate of 260,000-550,000, but with an adjusted lower bound (reduced by 90%) to reflect occupancy and the insensitivities of the land cover data used. If these numbers were accurate for 2005 as proposed, then the suspected population decline of 25-49% (best estimate 35–49%) since 2005 (see Population Trend text) yields an adjusted total in 2023 of 13,260–412,500 (best estimate 13,260–357,500). A bespoke internal analysis using land cover data from 2010 (with totals adjusted for forest loss rates since) and an approximate density of 0.5–5 birds/km<sup>2</sup> (reflecting a range of densities recorded by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. [2009] and by Kumar and Shahabuddin [2012]) suggests a similar global population of 12,750–63,750. This alternative total is congruent with the scenarios provided by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. (2009) but suggests that their more pessimistic scenarios were likely more accurate. Accordingly, but reflecting the great uncertainty in the population size of this species, the total is set here to 10,000-70,000 mature individuals."

Legally protected in most range states; for example, in India it is listed&#160;in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Almost the entire global population now resides in a greatly fragmented protected area network (this study, eBird 2024, UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2024); in some instances protected area designations were made almost exclusively to safeguard populations of this species (e.g. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and Dihing-Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, both in Assam; A. Choudhury&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In Assam, a species action plan was published in 2023 (Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2023) and a species-recovery project organised by Wildlife Trust India is underway.<br/><br/>In order to establish a captive-breeding population, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) at Slimbridge, UK received 10 White-winged Ducks from Thailand in 1955, with the intention of breeding them (Green 1993b); however, none reproduced and the last bird died in 1961 (with most dying from avian tuberculosis, to which captive populations of this species seem to be particularly susceptible; Foote 2023). The current captive population in Europe and North America originates from 10 birds (seven males, three females) collected in Assam (India) in 1969-1970, all of which were probably closely related (Foote 2023). The captive population of White-winged Ducks was impressively increased to <em>c</em>. 200 in 2000, but has since declined precipitously to fewer than 25 in 2022 (Figure 1.2,&#160;in<em> </em>Foote 2023) and will likely be extinct by 2027 (Foote 2023). The captive population held in Europe is faring better, but remains comparatively small (<em>vs </em>other wildfowl species). A conservation programme led by EAZA supported by the European Union LIFE NGO funding programme currently focuses on ex-situ conservation (EAZA 2024); in July 2023 it was recorded that the programme had 76 White-winged Ducks across 23 institutions in Europe. Other captive populations are held by other institutions and private hobbyists globally, including in South-East Asia (A. Berryman pers. obs.). From an unknown source, some birds were recently reintroduced to Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, where they are regularly seen (eBird 2024); however, the size of this reintroduced population, or whether it is truly sustainable given the species was extirpated from the site some time during the 1990s, is unknown.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conservation actions must be urgently addressed. Ahmed <em>et al</em>. (2023) produced a blueprint for recovery of the species in Assam, but with suggestions that would almost certainly benefit the species throughout its range. First, they recommend that existing protected areas are strengthened by increasing enforcement and engaging local communities. Second they suggest that areas of suitable habitat in non-protected forests are established, with the aim of establishing these as protected areas (or OECMs) that are effective at safeguarding populations of White-winged Duck. Existing habitat should be restored by the de-siltation and weeding of forest wetlands, as well as the avoidance of contamination from oil drilling, and new habitat could be created via reforestation efforts and wetland creation; it should be noted however, that the latter will likely take time to be effective. Third, they recommend strengthening existing legislation and improving enforcement to prevent hunting and the poaching of eggs; this should be done in parallel with community engagement to discourage accidental and intentional offtake. Fourth, disturbance by local people and by tourists should be mitigated by identifying nesting/feeding areas to local people and staff so that they can be avoided. Investigate whether Assam could and should develop a captive-breeding programme and establish a captive-breeding centre. Fifth, research aimed at determining local attitudes to the species should be carried out, as well as determining which livelihood practices are currently affecting the species; this could be coupled with awareness-raising campaigns to educate local people how these practices can be carried out in less damaging way.&#160;<br/><br/>Similar conservation action blueprints should be drawn for the species elsewhere in its range, particularly in Myanmar, Cambodia and Indonesia, where the only remaining viable populations persist. The reintroduction project in Thailand should be reviewed and, if deemed successful, could be replicated in areas where threats are thought to have been adequately addressed.<p></p>While it is planned for European-hosted White-winged Ducks to be exported to the United States to facilitate the latter's captive-breeding programmes, this has not yet happened (Foote 2023).","Usually found alone or in small groups, the species is most easy to see at dawn and dusk when moving between daytime roosts and the species' feeding sites (Green 1993a, Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It inhabits stagnant or slow-flowing natural and artificial wetlands, within or adjacent to evergreen, deciduous or swamp forests, on which it depends for roosting and nesting, usually in tree-holes. Although lowlands (below <em>c</em>.400 m) provide optimum habitat, it occurs up to 1,400 m, especially on plateaux supporting sluggish perennial rivers and pools. It has been described as omnivorous (Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005), with pondweed, small fish, aquatic snails, spiders and insects being consumed regularly (Green 1993a).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Breeding season may vary across its range so that hatching coincides with the early wet season, when food supply may be more favourable (Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). The clutch size can vary to quite an extent with a range of 6-13 in captivity and 2-12 in the wild (Mackenzie and Kear 1976, Green 1993a, Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).<p></p>","Small, fragmented populations are vulnerable to extinction from hunting and collection of eggs and chicks for food or pets. While trade may be more of a local threat to the species, off-take for hunting, which goes relatively unreported, is a far more serious issue (Green 1993b). The extent to which these threats have affected it in different parts of its range varies. For example, hunting and nest robbery were identified as probably the only threats to have driven the species extinct in Lao PDR (Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press), while on Sumatra the almost total clearance of flat, low-lying forests (Global Forest Watch 2023) for conversion to oil-palm (and to a lesser extent rubber) plantations (Descals&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, Wang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2023) will likely have been the principal driver of rapid declines there, as well as probably the extirpations in Peninsular Malaysia and on Java. In Myanmar, hunting, disturbance and habitat loss have likely caused rapid declines historically, and probably continue to do so. Hunting, including nest robbery, is a threat in north-east India as well as elsewhere.","The rapid decline of this once widespread species is largely attributable to the destruction, degradation and disturbance of riverine (e.g. wetland drainage [Green 1993b]) and forest habitats that this species is dependent on, including the inappropriate management of forests (e.g. forest burning during the dry season [see Green 1993b]). It may be particularly susceptible to loss of large trees with nesting holes<strong>&#160;</strong>(W. Duckworth&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006). The resultant small, fragmented populations are vulnerable to extinction from stochastic environmental events, loss of genetic variability, disturbance, hunting and collection of eggs and chicks for food or pets. While trade may be more of a local threat to the species, off-take for hunting, which goes relatively unreported, is a far more serious issue (Green 1993b). The extent to which these threats have affected it in different parts of its range varies. For example, hunting and nest robbery were identified as probably the only threats to have driven the species extinct in Lao PDR (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press), while on Sumatra the almost total clearance of flat, low-lying forests (Global Forest Watch 2023) for conversion to oil-palm (and to a lesser extent rubber) plantations (Descals&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, Wang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2023) will likely have been the principal driver of rapid declines there, as well as probably the extirpations in Peninsular Malaysia and on Java. In Myanmar, hunting, disturbance and habitat loss have likely caused rapid declines historically, and probably continue to do so. In particular, in the species' stronghold in the Hukaung Valley, rates of forest loss have been very high and the proliferation of gold-mining is now a well-established threat. (Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Papworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Global Forest Watch 2023).<br/><br/>The most comprehensive assessment of current threats comes from north-east India, where a significant minority of the world's remaining population remains. Here, Ahmed <em>et al</em>. (2023) identified habitat degradation as a key threat, driven by oil extraction industries, the siltation of wetlands, proliferation of unnamed weed species and wetland draining. Moreover, forest loss caused by illegal logging and encroachment was identified as a threat, although in this region it is probably less so than in other parts of the species' range. Disturbance is a key issue throughout the species' range, and in India is chiefly caused by unregulated tourism, and non-timber resources extraction from forests. Hunting, including nest robbery, is a threat in north-east India as well as elsewhere.<br/><br/>The impacts of climate change are poorly understood (Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2023 identified this as a key knowledge gap), but a preliminary study concentrating only on the north-east Indian population (Deka <em>et al</em>. 2022) projected minor losses of habitat by 2050.","Compiling an accurate global population size estimate for this species is obfuscated by a lack of robust count data from large parts of its range, but evidence of continuing declines from already low numbers (BirdLife International 2001) suggests that the global population size may now be very small. The status in each range state is discussed approximately from west to east / north to south.<br/><br/>India was long-considered this species' stronghold but it is evident that the species occupies considerably fewer sites, and in fewer numbers, than it did three generations ago (BirdLife International 2001, Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2023). The Indian population was previously estimated to number 300–400 individuals based on surveys in the early 1990s (Choudhury 1996), however is postulated now to be 'far less as the species has lost a significant part of its habitat in the last 25 years' (Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2023). As evidence, the species has disappeared from several formerly occupied sites (see Figure 2: Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2023), with no records in recent surveys from, for example, Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and Doomdooma Dangori Reserve Forests, which had 'large populations' of White-winged Duck in the 1990s (Talukdar and Bhattacharjee 1994, Choudhury 1996). Recent surveys found only a total of 24 individual ducks from three forest areas (Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2023). Rationalising these data into population estimates is difficult in the absence of coordinated counts, but recent observations from even purported strongholds have rarely involved more than 1–2 pairs being seen, and combined with the collapse in the number of sites with recent observations, it is estimated that since counts of the early 1990s, the population in India has declined considerably. The precise number may be uncertain, but the conclusion from the limited evidence above is that the maximum population in India is unlikely to exceed 150 adults. Most plausibly, the Indian population now falls within a band of 50-150 mature individuals.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, data are even more sparse. Nonetheless, recent surveys (2016–2020) found birds persisting along the Chindwin River (and its tributaries) in Sagaing and Kachin, principally at Hukuang and Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuaries. At Hukuang Valley WS&#160;the species remained regularly reported 'on all main streams and oxbow lakes surveyed'&#160; (R. Tizard pers. obs., in Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2020). Tordoff <em>et al</em>. (2007) suggested that the population of White-winged Ducks here was 'several times greater' than the 10 birds they counted in surveys conducted in 2003–2005, and this is validated by an observation of 19 birds (not all of which, however, were likely to be mature individuals) observed in the Hukaung Valley WS in August 2009 (eBird 2023). The total population in Myanmar is precautionarily estimated at 40–100 mature individuals, accounting for observations of rapid habitat loss and degradation at both wildlife sanctuaries (particularly since 2016: Global Forest Watch 2023) which is likely to have (potentially significantly) reduced numbers since many of these surveys were carried out.<br/><br/>In Thailand, very few wild birds remain. A recent photographed record from Thung Yai Naresuan WS (eBird 2023) indicates that a population probably persists in Thailands remote western forests, but the area of suitable habitat here indicates that this is unlikely to comprise a large population. A recent reintroduction project at Phu Khiao WS is yet to be proven self-sustaining. White-winged Duck is almost certainly extinct in Peninsular Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia. There are no recent records from Viet Nam or Lao PDR, where it is probably extinct (or, if any population does persist, must now be tiny and functionally so) (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press, eBird 2023).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, the population has declined since a proposed estimate of 100 birds in 2007 (J.C. Eames <em>in litt</em>.) and likely now comprises (potentially far) fewer than 50 mature individuals (S. Mahood in litt. 2023), with no recent records away from Preah Vihear (C. Poole <em>in litt</em>. 2023).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, the population has evidently totally collapsed since BirdLife International (2001) identified 20 then recent (1980–2000) sites on Sumatra, most of which have now been totally denuded of forest. Across the island it is now very rare, with remnant populations confirmed from only Way Kambas National Park (where probably fewer than 20 mature individuals) and the Kampar Peninsula (where similar numbers would probably be an optimistic estimate). There are (few) other localities where the species could still persist (e.g. Berbak National Park); the Sumatran population is estimated here to number 30–60 mature individuals, with the lower estimate of this probably being most accurate. There have been no records from Java for over 50 years (BirdLife International 2001) and here it is assumed extinct.<br/><br/>Combining all these data presents an estimate with considerable uncertainty totalling 165–380 mature individuals, which is rounded to 150–450 here to account for additional uncertainties with the data used, but noting that a population size at the lowest end of this estimate is now probably the most likely."

The habitat of <em>Coleus idukkianus</em> is undergoing a continuing decline in quality owing to land use changes to plantations and urban areas. The species occurs in four locations. The small subpopulations are vulnerable to local pressures and land degradation. It occurs in Reserve Forest areas, but there is no specific protection in place for the species. It is assessed as Endangered (EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)) on the basis of its restricted extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and number of threat-defined locations, and with a continuing decline in habitat quality. It requires urgent conservation action, including site protection and ex-situ conservation.

4615,"Analysis of historic and recent published accounts indicate extensive subpopulation declines in all major ocean basins over the last three generations as a result of overexploitation of eggs and adult females at nesting beaches, juveniles and adults in foraging areas, and, to a lesser extent, incidental mortality relating to marine fisheries and degradation of marine and nesting habitats. Analyses of subpopulation changes at 32 Index Sites distributed globally (Figure 1, Table 1; see the Supplementary Information) show a 48% to 67% decline in the number of mature females nesting annually over the last 3–generations. <br/> <br/><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong> In accord with the IUCN criterion that Red List Assessments focus on the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001a), this assessment measures changes in the annual number of nesting females. Because reliable data are not available for all subpopulations, the present report focuses on 32 Index Sites (Figure 1, Table 1; see the Supplementary Information). These Index Sites include all of the known major nesting areas as well as many of the lesser nesting areas for which quantitative data are available. Despite considerable overlap at some foraging areas, each is presumed to be genetically distinct (Bowen <em>et al</em>. 1992, Bowen 1995) except for the Turtle Islands of Malaysia (Sabah) and Philippines (Moritz <em>et al</em>. 1991). These two Index Sites are, however, treated independently because of the different management practices exercised by the two governments and the resultant differences in subpopulation trends. Selection of the 32 Index Sites was based on two primary assumptions: (1) they represent the overall regional subpopulation trends and (2) the number of individuals among Index Sites in each region is proportional to the actual population size in that region. Any regional inconsistencies in this proportion may result in a biased global population estimate. <br/> <br/>It should be noted that a major caveat of using the number of nesting females to assess population trends is that this data type provides information for the proportion of the adult females that nest in any given year, not the total adult female population. However, when monitored over many years, this index can be reliable for assessing long-term population trends (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996). In the case of green turtles, which display high inter-annual variability in magnitude of nesting (Limpus and Nichols 1987, Broderick <em>et al</em>. 2001a), using short-term or single-season data sets could misrepresent the actual mean number of nesters over a longer timeframe. To alleviate this potential source of error, we used multiple-year data sets whenever available. However, when single-season datasets represented the only quantitative information for a given time period, these data were used as long as they were in accord with qualitative information from other references. <br/> <br/>Because data on annual number of nesting females are not always available, we also used data on number of nests per season, annual hatchling production, annual egg production and annual egg harvest. When these proxies were used, we converted units to number of nesting females based on a constant figure of 100 eggs/nest and three nests/season/female, unless otherwise noted. These conversions were based on the assumptions that (1) the mean number of eggs/nest and nests/female/season differ insignificantly through time, and (2) efforts to monitor nesting female activity and egg production are consistent through time. When using egg harvest data, we also assumed that harvest effort was consistent during all years for which data are available and 100% of the eggs were harvested in any given year. We believe these assumptions are accurate, but their absolute validation is very difficult. Qualitative information does, however, suggest that they are reasonable assumptions. For example, in the case of historic egg harvest, the same group of people usually harvested the eggs at a particular nesting beach each year, and they typically took every egg they could find (e.g., Parsons 1962, Pelzer 1972). <br/> <br/>In the present assessment, population abundance estimates are based on raw data, linear extrapolation functions, and exponential extrapolation functions. In most subpopulations, more than one trajectory was exhibited over the 3–generation interval; changes in subpopulation size are thus often based on a combination of raw data and extrapolations. If no change is believed to have occurred outside the time interval for which published abundance data are available, the raw data were used to determine the change in population size. However, when it is believed that change in subpopulation abundance occurred outside the interval for which raw data were available, extrapolations we performed to determine the overall change. Linear extrapolations were used when it was believed that the same amount of change occurred each year, irrespective of total subpopulation size. Exponential extrapolations were used when it was believed that change was proportional to the subpopulation size. In cases where there is a lack of information on the specific rate of change, both linear and exponential extrapolations were used to derive population estimates. However, if extrapolations resulted in obviously false estimates, their results were discarded (see Table 5; see the Supplementary Information). <br/> <br/><strong>Generation Length.</strong> Generation length is based on the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (Pianka 1974). Although there appears to be considerable variation in generation length among sea turtle species, it is apparent that all are relatively slow maturing and long-lived (Chaloupka and Musick 1997). Green turtles exhibit particularly slow growth rates, and age to maturity for the species appears to be the longest of any sea turtle (Hirth 1997). As a result, this assessment uses the most appropriate age-at-maturity estimates for each index site. At Index Sites for which there are local age-to-maturity data, those data are used to establish generation length. When data are lacking, as they are for a majority of subpopulations, information from the closest subpopulation for which data are available are used to generate age-at-maturity estimates (Table 2; see the Supplementary Information). <br/> <br/>Estimates of reproductive longevity range from 17 y to 23 y (Carr <em>et al</em>. 1978, Fitzsimmons <em>et al</em>. 1995). Data from the apparently pristine Green Turtle stock at Heron Island in Australia’s southern Great Barrier Reef show a mean reproductive life of 19 y (Chaloupka <em>et al</em>. 2004). Because Heron Island is the only undisturbed stock for which reproductive longevity data are available (M. Chaloupka, pers. comm.), this datum is used for all Index Sites (Table 3; see the Supplementary Information). Thus, based on the range of ages-at-sexual-maturity (26 yrs to 40 yrs) and reproductive longevity from the undisturbed Australian stock (19 yr), the generation lengths used for this assessment range from 35.5 yrs to 49.5 yrs (Table 3; see the Supplementary Information). <br/> <br/><em>Uncertainties in assessment process:</em> As with any assessment based on historic data or small datasets, there is a great deal of uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. The sources of uncertainty are rooted in both the procedure itself as well as in the stochastic nature green of turtle biology. Both sources of uncertainty are ultimately related to a lack of information, which can be a common issue when dealing with an animal as long-lived as a Green Turtle. <br/> <br/>First and foremost is the uncertainty related to the assumptions invoked for this assessment. For example, if, contrary to our assumption, efforts to monitor nesting female activity and egg production were not consistent through time, then our results may be biased. Similarly, our estimates may be inaccurate if harvest effort or the relative amount of eggs harvested was not consistent through time. In addition, the use of extrapolations may have resulted in erroneous estimates of population change. The potential for this increased when extrapolations were made over long time intervals, when they were based on short-term data sets, or if the start and/or end points of extrapolations were erroneous. <br/>  <br/>Uncertainty may also be tied to Green Turtle biology. In particular, the substantial variability in the proportion of a population that nests in any given year may result in inaccurate comparisons between past and present data sets. For example, if the proportion of a subpopulation’s adult female cohort nesting each year oscillates over decadal or longer time frames, then it is conceivable that our estimates of annual change in nesting numbers do not correspond to actual changes in the entire subpopulation. Moreover, if our conversion values for eggs/nest and nests/female/season are not accurate for the specific subpopulation being addressed, inaccuracies may result. Lastly, with respect to the migratory behaviour of green turtles, it is expected that each of the Index Sites included in this assessment represent a distinct subpopulation. Indeed, current genetic data support this claim, however, in the absence of complete data for all rookeries, it is possible that turtles moving back and forth between nesting areas in close proximity could have gone undetected. It is thus conceivable that a female could be counted twice. This would, of course, only be a problem when subpopulation size is based on an actual count of individual turtles visiting the beach. Although unlikely, it amounts to an additional source of uncertainty in this assessment. <br/> <br/><strong>Population trends.</strong> Based on the actual and extrapolated changes in subpopulation size at the 32 Index Sites, it is apparent that the mean annual number of nesting females has declined by 48% to 67% over the last three generations (Table 5; see the Supplementary Information). In addition, it is apparent that the degree of population change is not consistent among all Index Sites or among all regions (Tables 5 and 6; see the Supplementary Information). Because many of the threats that have led to these declines are not reversible and have not yet ceased, it is evident that green turtles face a measurable risk of extinction. Based on this assessment, it is apparent that green turtles qualify for Endangered status under Criteria A2bd. <br/> <br/>The key supporting documentation is presented in the tables (see link to additional information below), and the full assessment is also available from <a href=""http://www.iucn-mtsg.org/red_list/"">the Marine Turtle Specialist Group web site</a>.","Green turtles have been afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (e.g., Navid 1982, Humphrey and Salm 1996, Fleming 2001, Fretey 2001). Among the more globally relevant designations are those of Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN; Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Hilton-Taylor 2000); Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A partial list of the International Instruments that benefit green turtles includes the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA), the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection, the Memorandum of Agreement on the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.<br/><br/>As a result of these designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. The lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived green turtles.","Like most sea turtles, green turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Hirth 1997). Upon leaving the nesting beach, it has been hypothesized that hatchlings begin an oceanic phase (Carr 1987), perhaps floating passively in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Carr and Meylan 1980, Witham 1991). After a number of years in the oceanic zone, these turtles recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in seagrass and/or marine algae where they forage and grow until maturity (Musick and Limpus 1997). Upon attaining sexual maturity green turtles commence breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas that are undertaken every few years (Hirth 1997). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones, often spanning thousands of kilometres (Carr 1986, Mortimer and Portier 1989). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (e.g., Limpus <em>et al</em>. 1994, Seminoff <em>et al</em>. 2003).",,"Green turtles, like other sea turtle species, are particularly susceptible to population declines because of their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages: from eggs to adults. Perhaps the most detrimental human threats to green turtles are the intentional harvests of eggs and adults from nesting beaches and juveniles and adults from foraging grounds. Unfortunately, harvest remains legal in several countries despite substantial subpopulation declines (e.g., Humphrey and Salm 1996, Fleming 2001, Fretey 2001). In addition, a number of incidental threats impact green turtles around the world. These threats affect both terrestrial and marine environments, and include bycatch in marine fisheries, habitat degradation at nesting beaches and feeding areas, and disease. Mortality associated with entanglement in marine fisheries is the primary incidental threat; the responsible fishing techniques include drift netting, shrimp trawling, dynamite fishing, and long-lining. Degradation of both nesting beach habitat and marine habitats also play a role in the decline of many Green Turtle stocks. Nesting habitat degradation results from the construction of buildings, beach armouring and re-nourishment, and/or sand extraction (Lutcavage <em>et al</em>. 1997). These factors may directly, through loss of beach habitat, or indirectly, through changing thermal profiles and increasing erosion, serve to decrease the quantity and quality of nesting area available to females, and may evoke a change in the natural behaviours of adults and hatchlings (Ackerman 1997). The presence of lights on or adjacent to nesting beaches alters the behaviour of nesting adults (Witherington 1992) and is often fatal to emerging hatchlings as they are attracted to light sources and drawn away from the water (Witherington and Bjorndal 1990). Habitat degradation in the marine environment results from increased effluent and contamination from coastal development, construction of marinas, increased boat traffic, and harvest of nearshore marine algae resources. Combined, these impacts diminish the health of coastal marine ecosystems and may, in turn, adversely affect green turtles. For example, degradation of marine habitats has been implicated in the increasing prevalence of the tumour-causing Fibropapilloma disease (George 1997).",

Research is needed on the impact and severity of forest fires, as well as investigating the postulation in Praveen J (2020) that invasive species may be a threat. Density studies throughout its range are needed to generate a more precise global population estimate, and to determine whether there are changes in density over time, particularly in response to climate change. Monitoring of habitat trends should continue using remote sensing data.<p></p>","Resident.

By far the most acute threat is that of habitat loss and degradation, particularly caused by summer fires which, in some years, destroy a large area of suitable habitat (Rajeev 2018). There are reports of ecotourism activities contributing to damage at some sites, although the impact of this is probably marginal. Similarly, invasive species were speculated by Praveen J (2020) to be a potential threat, but they concluded that further research was needed. Almost none of the suitable habitat for this species lies within India's protected area network, rendering almost all of it vulnerable to future threats. Although not mentioned by Praveen J (2020), climate change may prove a threat to this species, both in increasing the frequency and intensity of annual fires, and also reducing via an escalation to extinction effect, especially considering that encounter rates of this species are greatest in the highest altitude forests (Aparnadevi and Vinayan 2013).","The population size of this species has not been formally estimated, but this species' range comprises an area &lt;180 km<sup>2</sup>, and therefore its population size is assumed to be relatively small. The southernmost site, Vellarimala–Chembra, likely numbers &gt;250 mature individuals (Praveen J&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016) and is therefore suspected to number 250–750 mature individuals, equivalent to a density (that accounts also for occupancy) of approximately 3–9 mature individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, which is considered subjectively reasonable based on the densities of other laughingthrushes, and citizen science observations (eBird 2023). Assuming a relatively even density across its range (i.e. equivalent densities in the other three forest areas), then the total global population of this species is suspected to number <em>c</em>.530–1,600 mature individuals. A best estimate at the lower end of this range (530–1,200) because of reports of lower densities at some sites (Praveen J 2020)."

Extreme flooding events in the Brahmaputra valley, associated with rapid run-off from an increasingly denuded catchment, could damage grasslands, although some flooding may be beneficial to grassland quality. Similarly dam construction in the foothills of Arunachal Pradesh could negatively impact the species owing to changes in flow conditions (R.

The largest subpopulation is believed to be hosted by D'Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, which is thought to host a few hundred individuals (Rahman <em>et al</em>. 2022). An area further north, 'East Siang' in Choudhury (2021) also has recent records, although the population here is unlikely large. Choudhury (2021) noted that the Lower Dibang Valley also hosts a population that is 'globally important' and the area of suitable habitat is not considerably less than that of D'Ering and this may also host several hundred birds. The area of suitable habitat in Kaziranga National Park is potentially large, although birds are infrequently seen (eBird 2023), and it is improbable that the population here is any larger than D'Ering. At Manas, the area of habitat is also large and birds <em>are </em>frequently observed in numbers comparable to strongholds in Arunachal Pradesh (eBird 2023). The very isolated, and recently discovered, population around Loktak Lake (mostly in Keibul Lamjao National Park) is probably small (&lt;250 individuals), based simply on the very small area of suitable habitat. Combining reports from all parts of its range, the global population size of this species is probably between 1,500-4,000 mature individuals, with no population larger than 500-1,000 mature individuals."
22716358,"Considered Vulnerable due to its restricted range; it occurs at only five sites (four in India, one in Nepal) which are highly fragmented and vulnerable to stochastic pressures and subject to ongoing habitat degradation. It is not currently considered more threatened because all, or nearly all, of its range is contained within protected areas.","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed as Critically Endangered under B2ab(iii) in Nepal (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;It is known to occur in at least five protected areas, Chitwan National Park, Nepal and Kaziranga National Park, Manas National Park, Orang National Park, Keibul Lamjao National Park, India (A. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016, A. Rahman <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<strong></strong><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct surveys in remaining suitable habitat throughout its range to establish its current distribution and population status and develop a monitoring scheme (A. Rahman&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Survey suitable grassland reserves within the species' range for possible reintroductions (H. Baral and C. Inskipp <em>in litt</em>. 2016), noting that natural (re)colonisation is now highly unlikely given how fragmented remaining populations now are. Extend, upgrade and link existing protected areas, and establish new ones, in order to adequately conserve remaining tracts of grassland. Control livestock-grazing in protected areas to reduce rates of tall grassland loss and degradation. Promote widespread conservation awareness initiatives focusing on grassland regeneration and sustainable management of grassland to maximise both thatch productivity for local people and available habitat for threatened grassland birds. Control alien invasive plant species and implement flood control measures in and around national parks (A. Rahman&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Develop an action plan for the species (A. Rahman&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>","It is a sedentary resident of tall grasslands in the lowlands, where it is usually found near water, and at least historically on grassy plateaux at 900-1,200&#160;m in Meghalaya, India. In India it is thought to inhabit <em>Saccharum sponteneum</em> and <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> grassland however more work is needed to determine its exact habitat requirements (A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Nepal it is known to use <em>Narenga porphyrocoma</em> grassland (Baral and Chaudhary 2006). It is gregarious, but generally shy and difficult to observe, except during the breeding season, March-June, when it is more vocal and conspicuous.<p></p>",,"The rapid and extensive loss and modification of tall grasslands and reedswamp throughout its range has been the principal cause of considerable declines in range (and axiomatically abundance) over the past century. To a much lesser extent, these declines are suspected to be still ongoing, as a result of drainage, conversion to agriculture (primarily rice-paddy, sugarcane, mustard and tea plantations), overgrazing by domestic livestock, over harvesting of grass for thatch production, untimely cutting and burning of grass, inappropriate grassland management within protected areas and heavy flooding in the Brahmaputra valley, as a result of run-off from an increasingly denuded catchment. <em>Saccharum sponteneum</em> and <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> grasslands are heavily exploited for materials for thatch and for grazing. These grasslands are burnt during the summer dry period to encourage new growth, however this period of burning also coincides with the species' breeding period (A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2016). It is also threatened by the growth of invasive alien plant species such as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mikania micrantha</span>,&#160;<em>Mimosa diplotricha</em> and <em>Bombax ceiba&#160;</em>which can overrun grasslands and other habitats and render areas unsuitable&#160;(Baral and Chaudhary 2006, Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016, A. Rahman <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Dam construction within the species's range poses a threat to the species owing to changes in the flooding regime (A. Rahman&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). As a grassland specialist and highly sedentary species and because of habitat fragmentation it is unlikely to recolonize new suitable areas unless assisted (H. Baral and C. Inskipp <em>in litt</em>. 2016). All of these threats have been greatly abated in recent years due to a broadly effective national park network.<p></p>","The population size of this species is not precisely known, but given it is confined to only five sites it is suspected to be relatively small. The largest (or second-largest) remaining population, in Chitwan National Park, was estimated to number 1,400-2,200 mature individuals (Baral and Chaudhary 2006, Inskipp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The population in Kaziranga National Park is likely to be a similar size (or possibly slightly larger) (A. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016). There has been no attempt to estimate the other three sites of occupancy, but the area of suitable habitat in each of them is smaller than Chitwan and Kaziranga. Accordingly, these three sites combined is thought to host approximately 1,400-4,400 mature individuals (the minimum bound being the minimum number at one of Kaziranga/Chitwan, the upper bound being double the upper bound of one of Kaziranga/Chitwan). Combined, the global population is estimated to number 4,200-8,800 mature individuals."
22734628,"<em>Liocichla bugunorum&#160;</em>was first sighted in 1995, before it was formally described in 2006 after it was eventually mist-netted after four-days of field effort. The fact that the species went undiscovered for many years speaks to the undoubtedly small population. Continued surveys have never recorded more than ten individuals in one day, with only 14 individuals reliably known. The species is expected to occupy an area of only 140 km<sup>2</sup>, and the population is estimated at only 25-250 mature individuals. Consequentially, the species is precautionarily listed as Critically Endangered.","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>The type locality of the species at Lama Camp has been the target of a major conservation upgrade with the villagers starting a legal process to have the area declared a conservation reserve, and the species is now a conservation flagship species for the local community (R. Athreya&#160;<em>in litt</em>.&#160;2016).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct further surveys to improve understanding of the species' range, population and ecology, including intensive surveys in adjoining areas of Arunachal Pradesh, and also in adjacent areas of Bhutan. Appraise potential threats to this species. Ensure that habitats within the Kameng protected area remain safe by opposing further road developments.<br/><p></p>","Little is known about <em>L. bugunorum</em>. However, it is recorded from heavily disturbed hillsides and ravines with dense shrubbery, including secondary regrowth, and occasionally from forest edge (Rasmussen and Anderton 2012, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is reported from 2,060-2,340 m (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020) but may occur from 2,000-2,700 m (Rasmussen and Anderton 2012). They are most often seen in pairs in the summer, and small flocks in the winter (Rasmussen and Anderton 2012), generally feeding on small berries whilst foraging on the ground, though may be seen at all vegetation levels including the canopy (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).<p></p>",,"The threats to this species are poorly understood, especially as it occurs in disturbed habitats (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Regardless, the population may still be impacted by localised threats. Habitat at Lama Camp was fragmented the construction of a new road in 2012-2013 (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020), and Lama Camp overall is heavily logged (Athreya 2006). The construction of a major highway that intersects Lama Camp was reportedly planned (Athreya 2006), but this threat has so far has not been realised. Increased human disturbance and the construction of new roads would presumably represent a threat to the species. However, Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary has remained relatively untouched overall (Athreya 2006).","The population size of <em>Liocichla burunorum</em>&#160;is undoubtedly small, though it has not been comprehensively surveyed. The species occurs in one area covering&#160;<em>c. </em>140 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable habitat (calculated by sRedList [2023] using data from ESA&#160;[2022]) in Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, Arunachal Pradesh, India (Athreya 2006). The surveys by Athreya (2006), which led to the description of the species, identified 14 separate individuals, four seen near Bompu camp in 2006 and 10 seen in 2005 at Lama Camp. Although the population is likely higher than 14 individuals, the population is obviously small, especially considering the distinctive plumage and vocalisations mean the species is unlikely to be overlooked now that it has been described (Athreya 2006). All previous sightings are of small flocks of two to six individuals, and the species was missed completely in two separate survey attempts by Athreya (2006) in 2005. It was also not recorded in several surveys within the region from 1997 to 2002, five of which were within Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (Choudhury 2003) and within the elevational range of the species (Rasmussen and Anderton 2012). There has been a large increase in eBird records since the species was described. However, these sightings are almost exclusively along the accessible track between Lama Camp and Bompu Camp, and all of a small number of individuals (eBird 2024). Therefore, although the number of published sightings has increased, many of these are likely of the same small number of individuals (although it is notable that they are concentrated along a short section, with very few records from elsewhere along the well-surveyed road).<br/><br/>Habitat modelling suggests the species may occur over a wider range (Peterson and&#160;Papeş 2006), and there is hope the species' range also includes central and eastern Arunachal Pradesh and into Bhutan (Athreya 2006). Nonetheless, this is not yet confirmed and a precautionary approach must be taken that the species may not occur elsewhere and might be genuinely confined to the small area from which all observations come. Accordingly, the population size is estimated here at 25-250 mature individuals."
254095810,"<em>Ceropegia evansii</em> is endemic to the northern Western Ghats of Maharashtra, India. It is reported from Satara, Pune, Ratnagiri, Raigad, and Kolhapur states of Maharashtra, India. The species grows on the forest edges, and hill slopes and is associated with&#160;<em>Strobilanthes callosa</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Carissa spinarum. </em>The extent of occurrence (EOO) was calculated as 5,315 km<sup>2</sup> by drawing a minimum convex polygon using GeoCAT software and the area of occupancy (AOO) was calculated as 68 km<sup>2</sup>. The species is found in 17 locations. The species is severely fragmented and there is a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals and the quality of habitat. In addition, the total population size is small (estimated as under 200 mature individuals) and declining. Hence, it is assessed as Endangered.","Presently there is no report on any conservation action for this species. In the future conservation action plan is needed concerning the problem of habitat degradation and species invasion. Education and awareness to stop harvesting of tubers is also needed. Research is required to monitor the locations, habitat, population, distribution and threats.","It is found on the forest edges, open hill slopes and along bushes in open scrubland. It is associated with <em>Strobilanthes callosa </em>and&#160;<em>Carissa spinarum&#160;</em>(Yadav and Kamble 2008).",The tubers are eaten by local people (Kambale and Yadav 2019).,The threat to the species is mainly due to conversion of land to build residential and tourism infrastructure. Collection of tubers and degradation of quality of the habitat is another threat. Expansion of agricultural fields and livestock grazing is another minor threat to the species.,"The report prepared in 2008 states that only 10-15 mature individuals were seen in the last 20 years (Yadav and Kamble 2008). About 55 mature individuals were seen at Mulshi and 7 mature individuals at Lonavala (Aditya Gadkari pers. obs.) in 2022. In 2023, only 4-5 mature individuals were seen in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra (Aparna Lalit pers. obs. 2023). Around 5-10 mature individuals were seen at 3 locations in Satara district of Maharashtra (Sagar Kulkarni pers.obs. 2023)."
254095865,"<em>Ceropegia mohanramii </em>is endemic to the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra state in India, where it is known from a single low elevation coastal lateritic plateau. Over the last five years, there has been an continuing decline in the number of mature individuals, EOO, AOO and the quality of habitat. Currently, only 40-50 mature individuals are left. It has ongoing threats in the form of land-use change due to farming and grazing, with farmlands closing into the range of the species. Urgent intervention is needed for the species, and hence it is assessed here as Critically Endangered.","In-vitro regeneration was carried out by scientists and faculty from universities of Kolhapur, Satara and Jawahar in Maharashtra. About 1,200 micro-propagated saplings were transplanted to eight different natural localities in the Western Ghats of India, out of which one was in a protected area. After a year, the plants showed self-perpetuation at new site and exhibited over 76% of the establishment in natural conditions.

Flowering and fruiting for this species occurs from July to October.,,"The open lateritic plateau where the species grows has undergone major land use change due to increase in the number of farmlands and cultivation. Added to that, grazing by herbivores along the grasses on the plateau is also a severe threat.","Population estimation in the year 2018 resulted in 100-120 mature individuals (Mayuresh Kulkarni, unpublished data) which decreased to 40-50 in 2023 (pers. obs.)."
22693749,"While <em>Pluvialis squatarola </em>remains a widespread and abundant species it is listed as Vulnerable in response to increasing evidence for rapid population declines over the past three generations (23 years), estimated to be more than 30%. The exact causes of these declines are unknown, but a myriad of plausible threats have been identified including habitat loss and degradation, disturbance and hunting.<p></p>","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>This species is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU, although it is also listed on Annex II/B of the Directive as a species that may be hunted in several EU Member States. It is also listed on Annex III (protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex II of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 370 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for the conservation of this species on passage and in winter (EEA 2024). Some habitats along flyway routes are protected. The Australasian Wader Studies Group, along with BirdLife Australia's Shorebirds 2020 Project and committed volunteers continue to monitor migratory shorebirds within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Vine and Maurer 2016). China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of <em>Spartina </em>cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including <em>P. squatarola</em>) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016). North Korea became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and South-East Asian countries: Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by <em>P. squatarola</em> on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas, and many also for wintering. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organisations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong>Ensure population monitoring continues throughout and its range, and preferably expand it to other regions (particularly in East Asia and wintering grounds in Africa where data coverage is currently patchy). In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the main action needed for this is the amelioration of threats on its migration. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of <em>Spartina </em>cordgrass to prevent further loss of feeding habitat (much has already been lost to land reclamation; IUCN 2023). The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. Tools are available, such as AviStep (https://avistep.birdlife.org/) to ensure sustainable building of renewable energy infrastructure. Many of these threats, particularly development of coastal wetlands, apply also to the Arabian Peninsula where there is a need for sensible policy-making and implementation to reduce illegal killing and habitat loss (Brochet <em>et al</em>. 2016, de Fouw <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is an urgent need to understand the threat posed by hunting across its range, particularly in the Americas, Africa and the Middle East, where there is a lack of even descriptive understanding on the extent to which this occurs.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It departs its breeding grounds from late-July to September (southward movements continuing into November) and returns from late-May to June (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It breeds from May to August in solitary well-dispersed pairs and forages alone or in small loose flocks of up to 30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is gregarious during the winter however, often roosting in large flocks containing up to several thousand individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species nests in the high Arctic in both upland and valley locations between the treeline and the coast, utilising dry stony tundra with sedge, moss, lichen, grass or dwarf birch, peat ridges in tundra marshes, dry exposed ridges, riverbanks, raised sand or gravel beaches, and rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species frequents intertidal mudflats, saltmarshes, sandflats and beaches of oceanic coastlines, bays and estuaries (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). During migration it may also be found inland on lakes, pools or grasslands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season the diet of this species consists largely of adult and larval insects such as beetles and Diptera as well as some plant matter (e.g. grass seeds and stems) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> When on the coast in its wintering range the species takes marine polychaete worms, molluscs and crustaceans (e.g. crabs, sand shrimps), occasionally also taking insects (e.g. grasshoppers and beetles) or earthworms when in inland habitats on passage (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow scrape on dry ground in exposed, stony sites, neighbouring nests not less than 400 m apart (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information</strong> In the UK there is evidence that the removal of Common Cordgrass (<em>Spartina anglica</em>) from tidal mudflats using a herbicide is beneficial for the species (Evans 1986).","Hunting is a probable threat to this species in parts of its range, as the hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g.,&#160;Gallo-Cajiao&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, Yong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022). The extent of hunting in the Arabian Peninsula region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The extent of hunting in the Americas flyway (chiefly in Latin and South America) is not well quantified, but there is evidence that birds are harvested in Guyana (Andres <em>et al</em>. 2022) and probably elsewhere in the Caribbean. There is subsistence level harvest of the species in Alaska; totalled numbers for this species combined with golden plovers is low (Naves <em>et al.</em> 2019) and there is no possibility this represents a significant threat to the species.","Numerous threats have been identified, but the extent to which any of them are driving observed declines is unknown, with much more research needed before threats can be targeted for mitigation.<br/><br/>Climate change has been identified for several shorebird species as a threat that is driving reduced breeding productivity by a number of mechanisms (e.g.&#160;Meltofte&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Eikelenboom 2016, Kubelka<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2018); more research for this species specifically is needed. Available breeding habitat based on predicted distribution under future climate change scenarios is predicted to reduce by between 82% (RCP 4.5) and 87% (RCP 8.5) by 2070 (Wauchope <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. At Barr Al Hikman, Oman, where up to 5% of the Asian-East African Flyway population has been reported to overwinter, planned urban developments, the aquaculture (for shrimp) industry, oil refineries and disturbance from fishing industries and falcon hunting were all identified as threats by de Fouw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018) and these almost certainly apply to other important staging and wintering sites in the broader region. The extent of hunting in this region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). Rapid land-use change and loss of mudflats are also major threats here. It is also threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2005). Again, these threats are probably widespread in the region.<br/><br/>Significant numbers of <em>P. squatarola</em><em>&#160;</em>migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. The extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (Murray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in&#160;<em>c</em>. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continued to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien&#160;<em>Spartina alterniflora&#160;</em>cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the following as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In the Americas threats are not well understood, but Smith <em>et al</em>. (2023) likewise cite urban and wetland development as well as disturbance as likely key threats. The extent to which hunting is a threat in the Americas is largely unknown. There is subsistence level harvest of the species in Alaska; totalled numbers for this species combined with golden plovers is low (Naves <em>et al</em>. 2019) and there is no possibility this represents a significant threat to the species. Less clear, however, is the impact of more widespread hunting; e.g. Andres <em>et al</em>. (2022) found the species in 44.4% of markets in Guyana, and AFSI (2020) reported low levels of hunting in northern South America and the Caribbean.","Spans all major flyways with a vast breeding range that covers much of Arctic Russia and the Nearctic.<br/>Breeding populations in western Siberia winter in Western Europe and West Africa where estimated to number <em>c</em>.200,000 (von Roomen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Nagy and Langendoen 2020). Numbers wintering in south-west Asia and eastern Africa less certain, but suspected to be <em>c</em>.90,000&#160;(Wetlands International 2012). An additional 30,000 suspected to winter in South Asia (Wetlands International 2012). Numbers in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway estimated at <em>c</em>.80,000 in 2016 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2023). The total number breeding in Siberia is therefore estimated to be <em>c</em>.240,000-280,000, assuming not all of the estimates discussed previously, which are made from non-breeding areas, refer to mature individuals (which are assumed to make up 60-70% of the population).<br/><br/>Larger numbers breed in the Nearctic. Andres <em>et al</em>. (2012) previously estimated 262,700 across Alaska and Arctic Canada, however this noted that the estimate would increase as the PRISM surveys were incomplete. A draft status review of shorebirds reports a final PRISM estimate of at least 1 million birds, based on <em>c</em>.725,000 (353,000-1,100,000) in Arctic Canada (Bart <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and an additional <em>c</em>.260,000 from Alaska, but the latter covers only a proportion of the species' Alaskan breeding range, and the number in Alaska may be closer to that from Arctic Canada. Accordingly, the number of birds in the Nearctic is estimated at <em>c</em>.1,000,000-2,000,000, most of which are probably mature individuals given they are from breeding season surveys.<br/><br/>Combining estimates yields a total population of <em>c</em>.1,250,000-2,250,000 mature individuals. The total population estimate used here is a broader bracket of 1,000,000-2,500,000 mature individuals, acknowledging that there are several elements of uncertainty, including the extent to which populations have declined since population estimates were made, and the possibility that the Siberian population may be underestimated."
254475077,"This recently described species is restricted to Gujarat state, western India, where it is known from a relatively restricted area. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 251 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 20 km<sup>2</sup>, therefore below the threshold for the Endangered category under criteria B1 and B2. So far only five subpopulations are known, belonging to five locations as it is not clear that the threats would simultaneously impact all five known subpopulations (condition ""a"" of B criterium). Finally, there are increasing human activities in the area (coal and limestone mining, wind turbine installation and road construction) that constitute severe threats to the species persistence as they are resultinging in a continuing decline in the area, extent and quality of the habitat. The species therefore qualifies as Endangered (B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)).&#160;This is a recently described species, hence, a priority is to undertake further research to the species distribution, its population size and population trend.","One known subpopulation falls within a protected area (Baranda Reserve Forest).<br/><br/>This is a recently described species, hence, no official conservation measures have been enforced yet.

The area also faces the problem of an invasive alien plant species, <em>Neltuma juliflora</em> (Sw.) Raf. (= <em>Prosopis juliflora</em>), which is found in the species range.","The species is known so far only from five subpopulations from a relatively restricted area (Patel <em>et al</em>. 2024). A total of approximately 1,860 individuals have been censused, ranging between less than 50 (Fulra-Dhareshi road and Baranda subpopulations) to more than 1,500 (the Umarsar subpopulation), where the species is locally common (Patel <em>et al</em>. 2024)."
15954,"Leopards are widely distributed across Africa and Asia, but populations have become reduced and isolated and they are now extirpated from large portions of their historic range. Due to their wide geographic range, secretive nature and habitat tolerance, Leopards are difficult to categorize as a single species. Evidence suggests that Leopard populations have been dramatically reduced due to continued persecution from increased human populations (Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Selvan <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Abade <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Bleyhl&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2021); habitat fragmentation (UN 2014); increased illegal wildlife trade (Datta&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Rostro-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016); excessive harvesting for medicinal use and ceremonial use of skins, spiritual and cultural use of the body parts including skin, claws, teeth, tail, paws, skin and fat (Naude&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020); prey base declines (Hatton <em>et al. </em>2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari and Carpaneto 2006, Datta&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014, Selvan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014); and poorly managed trophy hunting (Balme&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). Throughout North, East (specifically the Horn of Africa) and West Africa, Middle East, East and Southeast Asia, Leopards have suffered marked reductions and regional extirpations due to poaching for illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and prey loss. Human populations are increasing by 2.7 percent annually in sub-Saharan Africa according to the UN. Between 2022 and 2050, the fastest human population growth is projected to occur in Africa. The population in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double by 2050 (https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population). The rate of cropland expansion accelerated in Africa over the past two decades. There was a more than twofold increase from 2016–2019 compared to 2004–2007. Countries in West, Central, and East Africa all saw large increases in cultivated land. Most of those new croplands were carved out of natural habitats rather than pasture or abandoned farmland (<a href=""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149624/crop-expansion-accelerates-in-africa"">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149624/crop-expansion-accelerates-in-africa</a>). Deforestation in southeast Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). Intensive snaring for bushmeat in southeast Asia has substantially reduced Leopard prey and caused direct mortality (Rostro-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). Since the last assessment in 2016, evidence of genetic inbreeding among isolated populations has presented an additional threat to population viability (Marchenkova <em>et al. </em>2020, Cho&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022, Yin&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). <br/><br/>We estimate the current confirmed extant range of Leopards presented in this assessment (7,608,096 km², see map) is a reduction of 11% from the previous assessment from 2016 (8,515,935 km², Stein <em>et al. </em>2016). Range losses in sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, Southeast Asia and China counterbalance gains in India and Southwest Asia (Ostrowski&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022). Only in Northeast China and Russian Far East the leopard’s breeding range increased during 20 years from 7,000 km² to 14,000 km² (Jiang&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016, Vitkalova&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2016, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by &gt;30% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici <em>et al. </em>2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Leopard population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, small, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013, Ripple&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016, Rogan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010). In southern Africa, illegal bushmeat hunting removes up to 620,000 kg of wild ungulates annually from the Okavango Delta, Botswana (Rogan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52% in East Africa and 85% in West Africa (Craigie&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001, Fusari&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7% and 74.1% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a &gt;50% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa within three generations. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia, many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014). Moreover, in Golestan National Park, Iran, the main prey of Persian Leopard declined by 66–89% since the 1970s due to poaching, with the only increase in prey population observed in Wild Boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), which is not being hunted due to religious beliefs (Ghoddousi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In South-east and East Asia, intensive snaring and poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. The Indian Leopard is widespread, though somewhat fragmented outside protected areas and thus an easy target for illegal wildlife trade (Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023). In 2018 alone, 90 Leopard poaching events were reported. A lot of the poaching incidents likely go unreported (Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023). A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2014) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa (Naude&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020b).<br/><br/>Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman <em>et al.</em> (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. In 2022, Muller&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2022) used web-sourced images of Leopard trophy hunts and showed that hunting violations were occurring in southern Africa, including non-permitted hunting of female Leopards in South Africa and Zambia, and illegal hounding in Namibia and South Africa. In recent years, concerns about unsustainable trophy hunting has led to temporary bans in South Africa (2016–2018), Zimbabwe and Botswana (2013–2022). In these countries, hunting has been reinstated (2015). Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat, prey depletion, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are neither fully documented nor fully understood; they have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.","The Leopard is included in CITES Appendix I. Trade of Leopard skins and derivative products is restricted to 2,648 individuals in 12 countries (with Kenya and Malawi abstaining from using from hunting leopard) in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, the practices within the hunting industry have been called into question by wildlife researchers and conservationists (Packer <em>et al. </em>2011). In 2010, the government of Namibia conducted an assessment of trophy hunting in response to calls for an increase in permits amid reports of unethical hunting practices. Zambia placed a moratorium on Leopard and Lion hunting in 2013 due to concerns about the conservation status of the populations. In South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana, researchers have developed regional studies of the hunting quota systems that incorporate measures of trophy quality and regulate the distribution of permits. These quota studies integrate previous hunting data to prescribe the number and distribution of hunting permits with local stakeholder participation. In Botswana, a moratorium on Leopard hunting was implemented from 2014 to 2022 when a quota was released (DWNP 2021). South Africa suspended trophy hunting of Leopards for the year in 2016.<br/><br/>Regulating trophy hunting will only address a percentage of Leopard mortality; human-Leopard conflict within livestock and game farming communities is likely the greatest source, particularly in southern Africa. In many countries of southern and East Africa, farmers are allowed to kill predators that are considered a threat to life and property with permits distributed retroactively. It is likely that a high percentage of Leopards are killed without reporting and therefore the exact numbers of Leopards killed through actual or perceived conflict is unknown. Generally, efforts to calculate mortality through human-wildlife conflict have been considered unreliable. Since the majority of Leopard range is outside of protected areas, conflict mitigation strategies such as livestock husbandry, compensation/ insurance programmes, alterations in trophy hunting permit distribution and public awareness have all been used to assist farmers and increasing tolerance for living with leopards (Balme&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009b, Stein&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010). Where conflict Leopards have been identified, translocation has been tried often with negative results (Weilenmann <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya <em>et al. </em>2011), however, effective translocation criteria have been developed based on suitable release site characteristics (Weise&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015). Namibia and Botswana have promoted wildlife conservation through the devolution of wildlife management and the establishment of benefit sharing initiatives between photographic tour operators, professional hunters and communities through Conservancies and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs; Jones 1993). These initiatives were modelled after previous efforts such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In North and West Africa, the Middle East and large parts of Asia, Leopards are largely restricted to protected areas where they are afforded refuge if poaching is not significant. However, many of these protected areas are not large enough to maintain genetically viable populations and will likely require intensive management. As positive example, the creation of large national parks on the Sino-Russian border played crucial role in restoration of Amur leopard population (Vitkalova&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). In Indo-Malayasia and China, Leopards require increased protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007). <br/><br/>Since the previous status update, researchers have undertaken population surveys within protected areas throughout Leopard range. These surveys have improved our understanding of Leopard status with greater resolution and in some cases generated population estimates. We recommend increased population surveys for Leopards, in particular across Central Africa, Angola, South-east Asia and South-west China.<br/><br/>To address the use of Leopard skins for traditional ceremonies, conservationists in South Africa have partnered with textile companies and communities to provide faux-fur alternatives (Naude&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>International collaborative efforts to facilitate cross- boundary protections and potential connectivity have been underway developing among researchers and country leadership for the Persian Leopard (Bleyhl&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022). Currently, only around 11% of the core habitat patches of the Persian Leopard fall within protected areas across its entire range (Bleyhl <em>et al.</em> 2022). The collaboration between Russia and China creates possibility to launch in 2024 the Sino-Russian transboundary nature reserve, covering 90% of Amur leopard current range (Y. Darman, pers. comm. 2024). Leopard population recovery efforts are currently underway with reintroduction projects in the Greater Caucasus (Rozhnov&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022), the Russian Far East (Y. Darman, pers. comm. 2023) and Africa (McManus <em>et al. </em>2022, Power <em>et al.</em> 2021). Researchers are exploring efforts to reintroduce the Arabian Leopard from local captive facilities (Budd and Leus 2013).","<strong>Habitat Types and Range</strong><br/>Leopards occur in the widest range of habitats among any of the Old-World Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). They are found in the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa in Namibia and Botswana. There are remnant populations in the arid regions of North Africa in Egypt, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. They persist in rugged montane regions of southwest Asia in Iran, in a varied range of landscapes in India and in the savanna grasslands of East and southern Africa. Leopards live in mountainous environments up to an altitude of 4,600 m on Mt. Kenya and 5,200 m in the Himalayas. They also thrive in the rainforests of West and Central Africa as well as Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. A remnant Leopard subpopulation also persists in the temperate coniferous-broadleaf forests in snowy regions of the Russian Far-East and North-East China. Leopard subpopulations also occur in suburban and urban environments in India and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Leopards have survived outside protected areas in many parts of India since historical times (Daniel 1999) and even today high density of Leopards does occur among high human densities (Singh 2005, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2013), although associated levels of conflict can also be high (Athreya<em> et al. </em>2011). <br/><br/>Leopards prefer to hunt in areas that provide sufficient cover despite higher prey densities elsewhere when sympatric with larger competitors (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2006). <br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong><br/>Leopard diet is related to prey availability and presence of larger competitors. Generally, Leopards prefer medium-sized ungulate prey (10–40 kgs) where available (Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2006). They have a highly varied diet, however, feeding on insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals up to large ungulates. Though the Leopard as a species has the reputation of being a generalist, often individuals will become adept specialists for a particular prey item. These individuals will feed almost exclusively on that prey, occasionally supplementing their diet with other food items when necessary. Where competitors are present, Leopards will cache their kills under thick vegetation or hoist their prey into the limbs of a tree. Hoisting behaviour is more often recorded where intraguild competitor density is higher. Male Leopards tend to hoist more often than females, particularly in the dry season when available ground cover is scarce (Stein <em>et al. </em>2015). In the absence of larger competitors, leopards feed on larger prey (Ramakrishnan <em>et al.</em> 1999, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In many parts of its range, the importance of domestic animals in their diet is also evident with dogs, goats and cattle forming a large proportion of their diet (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2001) sometimes even dominating the wild prey items in the diet (Athreya <em>et al. </em>2014, Shehzad <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dogs have been reported as important prey for Leopards (Edgaonkar and Chellam 2002, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2014). Overall studies on diet of Leopards are very scant across its Asian range. However, a number of dietary studies across the Persian Leopard range show the importance of wild mountain ungulates (80-95% of consumed biomass) such as the Bezoar Goat (<em>Capra aegagrus</em>) and Urial (<em>Ovis vignei</em>; Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2018, Ghoddousi <em>et al. </em>2016 ) as well as the Wild Boar when other prey species are depleted (Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Home Range Size</strong><br/>Leopard home range size varies with prey availability and habitat structure. Leopards have the largest ranges within arid and semi-arid environs where prey density is low. The largest recorded Leopard ranges include the Central Kalahari (mean = 2,182 km², Bothma <em>et al. </em>1997). The smallest recorded ranges correspond to rainforest habitats in south and southeast Asia. In Thailand, Grassman (1999) recorded home ranges as small as 8.8 km² for a female and an average 17.7 km² for two adult males. In India, three collared Leopards in human dominated landscapes exhibited home range sizes between 8 and 15 km² (Odden <em>et al.</em> 2014).","Leopards are targeted for trophy hunting and are illegally hunted for wildlife trade for their skins (used in traditional ceremonies), and bones and other parts (used for medicinal purposes in eastern cultures and for spiritual and cultural beliefs in West and Central Africa.","The primary threats to Leopards are anthropogenic. Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming, poaching and illegal trade have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005, Hunter 2013, Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023, Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023, Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching, thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.<br/><br/>Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey species causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2011). A recent study estimated that 54% of Leopard mortalities in Iran are in response to livestock depredation (Soofi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/>Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010b). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.<br/><br/>In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007, Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins used in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures and spiritual beliefs in African cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.<br/><br/><em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Genetics</strong></em><br/>We have changed our subspecies listing of Leopards from nine to eight based on morphological traits, molecular and biogeographic information (Miththapala <em>et al.</em> 1996, Uphyrkina<em> et al.</em> 2001, Kitchener <em>et al. </em>2017). Despite their wide range, Leopards in Africa (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) show little differentiation between populations (Anco&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017, Pečnerová <em>et al</em>. 2021). There is a deep divergence between the African and all Asian Leopard subspecies (dated to 500–600 kya), followed by much more shallow divergence between the Asian lineages (Paaijmans <em>et al. </em>2021). Within Asia, three main lineages are identified, roughly differentiating the East Asian subspecies <em>P. p. orientalis</em>, <em>P. p. delacouri</em> and <em>P. p. melas</em>, the Central Asian subspecies <em>P. p. fusca</em> and <em>P. p. kotiya</em>, and the West Asian subspecies <em>P. p. tulliana </em>(the subspecies <em>P. p. nimr</em> was not included in this study; Paijmans <em>et al.</em> 2021). Although the samples from individual subspecies seem to group together, with the exception of an unresolved relationship between <em>P. p. fusca</em> and <em>P. p. kotiya</em>, detailed inferences are challenging due to the low numbers of sampling localities in this study (Paijmans&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2021). Recent trends have shown a substantial reduction in Leopard range throughout West and Central Africa, South-east Asia and China; thus, we express concern about the loss of leopard diversity through local extinction of unique genetic lineages. These lineages may carry adaptations to local environments, which are crucial to conserve for maintaining resilient populations. The loss of potentially adaptive diversity is particularly concerning in the face of rapidly changing climate and further isolation of populations. In addition, small and isolated population may face the threat of inbreeding depression. For the Amur population leopard there have been cases of physical deformities due to low genetic viability (Marchenkova <em>et al.</em> 2020, Vitkalova <em>et al. </em>2023). Monitoring populations specifically to detect decreasing fitness, e.g. through low fecundity or high cub mortality, may further provide indications of inbreeding depression.","Highly adaptable and widely distributed, Leopards can persist in areas where other large carnivores have been extirpated. However, Leopards are declining throughout most of their range (Jacobson<em> et al. </em>2016). There are no robust estimates of the total number of mature individuals’ range-wide, but several Asian subspecies were assessed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List in 2016 and should retain these listings in 2023 based on the following population estimates and population trends:<ul><li>Amur Leopard (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>): Critically Endangered (C2a(ii); D, Jackson and Nowell 2008).</li><li>Amur population: CR C2a(ii): about 129–130 mature individuals (Wen <em>et al. </em>2022, Vitkalova<em> et al. </em>2023, Y. Darman, pers. comm. 2023).</li><li>North China population: CR C2a(i), about 174–348 (Laguardia <em>et al.</em> 2017).</li><li>Arabian Leopard (<em>P. p. nimr</em>): Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i), Al Hikmani&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2023): 70–84 mature individuals.</li><li>Javan Leopard (<em>P. p. melas</em>): Endangered (EN C2a(i), Wibisono <em>et al</em>. 2021): 319 mature individuals.</li><li>Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>): Vulnerable (VU D1, Kittle and Watson 2020): 776–777 mature individuals.</li><li>Persian Leopard (<em>P. p. tulliana</em>): Endangered (EN C2a(i), Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023): 750–1,044.</li><li>Indian Leopard (<em>P. p. fusca</em>) – Near Threatened (NT A2cd, Shivakumar <em>et al</em>. 2023): &gt;15,000</li><li>Indochinese Leopard (<em>P. p. delacouri</em>)- Critically Endangered (CR A2b+3b+4b, Rostro-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019): 77–766 mature individuals</li></ul>[<strong>Note</strong> that although the assessment for Amur Leopard (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>), published in 2008, has not changed, this assessment no longer appears on The IUCN Red List as the information within that assessment needs to be updated to be brought into line with the species-level assessment].<br/><br/>This current (2023) assessment looked at available information on Leopard status on a regional basis (as discussed below). Across the majority of range, Leopards have declined substantially (&gt;30%) over the last three generations as determined by extensive population surveys, expert input and indirect measures supporting our conclusion that Leopards remain listed as Vulnerable (criteria A2cd). Over the past three generations (22.3 years) regional Leopard populations in the Middle East, East and South-east Asia, West, parts of Central and East Africa have seen substantial range declines due to habitat fragmentation and forest clearing, prey reductions from the bushmeat trade, illegal harvest for skins and human-wildlife conflict and retaliation for livestock depredation. Leopards have completely disappeared from regions of North Africa where they were recorded in the previous assessment. Greater survey efforts in Java have identified 22 subpopulations (Wibisono <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the Caucasus, Leopards have maintained their populations or increased due to improved survey methods, expanded range or intensive conservation efforts. In Russian Far East and North East China, the transboundary population and its range has increased substantially due to creation of large national parks with good protection (details see Vitkalova <em>et al.</em> 2023). Although Leopard range has expanded due to greater survey techniques, the whole Indian Leopard population is suspected to have decreased by 24.5% over the last three generations (details see Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023).<br/><br/>A predictive model was created using 392 leopard estimates range-wide to generate a global population estimate of 261,636 individuals (interquartile range of 146,768– 461,512; Pranzini <em>et al. </em>2023). This estimate and subspecies estimates are higher than those provided by individual subspecies assessments and represent a strong baseline from which a revised estimate can be generated. <br/><br/><strong>AFRICA</strong><br/>There are few reliable data on changes in the Leopard (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) status (distribution or abundance) throughout Africa over the last three generations, although there is compelling evidence that subpopulations have likely declined considerably. Robust longitudinal data on 47 Lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) subpopulations—a sympatric large carnivore—demonstrated a 42% decline in abundance across populations in the last three generations (22.3 yrs) (Balm<em>e et al.</em> 2013). Lion population trends decreased in West, Central and East Africa, and increased in Southern Africa. Most of the factors driving Lion population declines (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to conflict, poorly managed trophy hunting) also affect Leopards. Indeed, pressure on Leopard populations is likely greater as a larger proportion of their range extends beyond protected areas. The increase in Lion populations in southern Africa was primarily due to the reintroduction of &gt;800 Lions to small, protected reserves in South Africa. Similar reintroductions were undertaken for Leopards (Briers-Louw and Leslie 2017). Fencing of protected areas was proposed as another significant factor contributing to the increase in Lion numbers in southern Africa (Packer<em> et al. </em>2013). In contrast, fences are far less effective at reducing detrimental edge effects of ‘protected' Leopard populations (Balme<em> et al. </em>2010a) and a far greater proportion of Leopard range falls outside protected areas (Swanepoel<em> et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>One main factor for Leopard declines in Africa is related to prey declines. Leopard population density across Africa is known to track the biomass of their principle prey species, medium and large-sized wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey<em> et al. </em>2013). Time series data from 1970 to 2005 on the main Leopard prey species in 78 protected areas in West, East and Southern Africa, revealed a 59% average decline in population abundance across the three regions. While ungulate and other large mammal populations increased by 24% in southern Africa, they declined by 52% in East Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Considering the Leopard’s dependence on wild prey species within its African range, concomitant Leopard declines in the same order of magnitude (&gt;50%) in West and East Africa can be inferred for the same time frame.<br/><br/>Another main driver of range loss and population decline of Leopards in Africa is habitat loss. Leopards have limited levels of ecological resilience to human-caused habitat fragmentation in Africa, and as a result are more restricted to conservation areas. Although male Leopards can successfully traverse fragmented and suboptimal habitat (Fattebert <em>et al.</em> 2013), in general Leopards in Africa require large contiguous habitats with low human impacts to reproduce successfully (Balme<em> et al. </em>2010a). However, in 2022, the population of sub-Saharan Africa has grown by 2.5 percent annually, more than three times the global average of 0.8 percent annually with a predicted population increase from 1.152 billion today to 2.094 billion by 2050 (UNDESA 2023), which in conjunction with a 57% increase in agriculture areas (from just over 200 million ha to almost 340 million ha) from 1975 to 2000 and a 21% decrease in natural vegetation in the region (Brink and Eva 2009) likely have negatively impacted the leopard populations. These increases in human population and habitat fragmentation were not accounted for in the previous assessment. As a subspecies<em> P. p. pardus </em>potentially qualifies as Vulnerable due to suspected population declines.<br/><br/>Although African Leopards can be regarded as a single genetic grouping for now (Anco <em>et al. </em>2017, Pečnerová <em>et al. </em>2021), geographically they are subject to different pressures that require area-specific categorizations and conservation status assessments. Therefore, we subdivided the African continent into regional units for more detailed and specific status assessments:<br/><br/><strong>North Africa</strong>: Leopards have not been documented in North Africa and likely remain extirpated. The Egyptian occurrence is considered very small, with no new documented evidence since the last assessment in Elba National Park in southeastern Egypt, and still no recorded signs in Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2023). Therefore, the North African subpopulation while likely extinct potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small and declining number of mature individuals, and a full assessment is recommended.<br/><br/><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong>: Numbers of sub-Saharan Leopards are declining within large portions of their range, particularly outside of protected areas. The populations within West, parts of Central and East Africa are decreasing significantly with increasing fragmentation and isolation throughout. In southern Africa, a large continuous population occurs through the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area extending across northern and central Namibia, all of Botswana into northern South Africa. However, large areas of northern Angola, Zambia (outside of protected areas), Mozambique, central Zimbabwe and central South Africa appear to be decreasing from previous estimates with Leopards disappearing from areas with increased human development and areas of intensive conflict with humans (R. Groom, P. Funston, M. Becker, A. Jorge and A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2023). Although urbanization is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (UNDESA 2023), the majority of the population is rural, and about 60–70% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods, mostly at a subsistence level. As a result, a large portion of the growing human population is expected to depend directly on expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing to survive. By 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to more than double to &gt;2 billion (UN 2023), and the area of cultivated land is project to increase by 51 million ha (approximately 21%, Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012), which likely will contribute to the continued population decline of Leopards in Africa. In the absence of proactive management, populations of Leopards and other large carnivores generally decline in concert with increased human population growth (Woodroffe 2000, Linnell <em>et al. </em>2001). In summary, the combination of widespread habitat loss (21% in sub-Saharan Africa in 25 years) and prey loss inside African protected areas (59% decline) is likely to have caused concomitant Leopard declines of &gt;30% over the last three Leopard generations. The Leopard subpopulation of sub-Saharan Africa still qualifies as VU (Criterion A2cd).<br/><br/>Additionally, we strongly recommend detailed status assessments for different parts of Africa to address regional needs and requirements (e.g. Henschel <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/><strong>ASIA</strong><br/><strong>Indian Leopard</strong> (<em style="""">P. p. fusca</em>): The known range of the Indian Leopard has increased compared to the previous assessment, but this is likely due to more intensive surveys conducted in previously unstudied wild and suburban environments. Nevertheless, the data on population size and trend of the Indian Leopard population across its whole range is still poor (Shivakumar<em> et al.</em> 2023). Poaching for wildlife trade is still a threat to Indian Leopards (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Shivakumar<em> et al. </em>2023). For example, Raza <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated that four Leopards per week have been poached for illegal wildlife trade over the previous 10 years. Additionally, high conflict is reported in some areas resulting in lethal control of problem individuals (Athreya<em> et al. </em>2013). Continuous decreases in wild prey are negatively impacting Leopard numbers in some regions (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Selvan <em>et al. </em>2014), indicating Leopard populations may decline in the future. Moreover, even in well protected areas, the recovery of Tiger numbers often results in lower Leopard numbers (Harihar <em>et al. </em>2011, Mondal <em>et al.</em> 2012), as Tigers are known to kill and displace Leopards (McDougal 1988, Odden <em>et al. </em>2010). The first ever scientific national census of Leopards around Tiger habitats in India (except the northeast) in 2014 estimated 7,910 individuals, with a speculated national total of 12,000–14,000 (Bhattacharya 2015). In 2018, 12,852 Leopards were estimated in the Tiger Landscapes of India with likely over 15,000 across India (Jhala <em>et al. </em>2020, Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023). The 2018 census indicates a population increase from the estimate in 2014 due to more comprehensive sampling (Jhala<em> et al.</em> 2020). The trend in non-Tiger States of India and in non-forested Leopard habitats is however not known and there are also indications for a decreasing population trend (Bhatt <em>et al. </em>2020). Based on all the information available, the Indian Leopard was assessed as Near Threatened under Criterion A2cd based on a suspected population reduction of 24.5% over the last three generations (Shivakuma<em>r et al. </em>2023). The decline is suspected from range loss and inferred based on actual or potential levels of exploitation. There are, however, also areas with positive population trends (Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023).<br/><br/><u><strong>Chinese leopard</strong> (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>, combined into one subspecies with <em>P. p. japonensis</em>)</u>: Even with the two subspecies recently combining&#160;to one, according to Kitchener <em>et al.</em> (2017), the last existing populations of Changbai Mountains and Loess Plateau in Central China were separated by 1,700 km of highly converted lands, including almost impassable for leopard 140 km wide break along Liaohe River. From this point of view, it makes sense to describe them separately at the population level.<br/><br/>The state of the most northern Amur population (described previously as Amur leopard,&#160;<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) has improved significantly. At the end the 20 century the last 27–32 Amur leopards inhabited Southwest Primorsky province of Russian Far East (Pikunov <em>et al. </em>2009, Murzin and Miquelle 2000). In nearby Laoyeling Mountains of Northeast China they were maximum 7–12 leopards (Yang <em>et al. </em>1998, Sun <em>et al. </em>1999). Due to the strong conservation measures total population was doubled since previous IUCN assessment. In 2014–2015, the joint camera-trap photo database counted the total Sino-Russian population minimum as 64–67 individually defined animals, including 5–8 cubs. The average density was 1.40 sp. per 100 km²<sup> </sup>on Russian side and 0.16 on Chinese side, while model-averaged SECR estimates predict 84 adults and sub-adults (Vitkalova<em> et al. </em>2018). Because, they are no exchange of camera trap data since 2016, we can only calculate possible size of the Amur leopard global population, summing the last available results of national surveys. In 2019, they were 49 individually defined adult leopard in North East China (Wen <em>et al.</em> 2022) and 105 adults in Russian Far East (Vitkalova <em>et al.</em> 2023). Adding the country-specific abundance estimates, thus ignoring individual movement across the border, overestimated abundance compared to the combined analyses by 18.0–21.5% (Vitkalova <em>et al. </em>2018, Shevtsova<em> et al. </em>2018). So, the Amur leopard global population can be estimated to 128–130 adult and sub-adult leopards (Yu. Darman, pers. comm. 2023). A key conservation achievements were the creation of Land of the Leopard National Park in Russia and North-East Tiger and Leopard National Park in China. The Sino-Russian network of protected areas has been increased 12 times during 25 years, from 1,532 km² to 18,045 km², covering 90% of current range of Amur leopard population. Implementation of SMART law enforcement provided a means of monitoring and improving law enforcement efforts, resulting in a consistent decline in poaching events. An ungulate recovery program, including mineral licks and supplemental winter forage to prevent large-scale winter die-offs, ensured a sufficient and increasing prey base. Even the improvement of protection and increase of prey base, the Amur population face with inbreeding problem, already resulting in physical deformities (Marchenkova <em>et al. </em>2020, Choi <em>et al. </em>2021, Vitkalova <em>et al. </em>2023). The proposed large-scale re-introduction program based on animals from captivity (Miquelle<em> et al.</em> 2010) is delayed. Instead, the re-location of leopards from existing population in Land of the Leopard national park was started in 2023 (Yu. Darman, pers. comm. 2023).<br/><br/><u><strong>North China leopard population </strong>(previously described as <em>P. p. japonensis</em> but subsumed by Kitchener<em> et al. </em>2017 as <em>P. p. orientalis</em>)</u>: This population is restricted to small, isolated protected areas in two separated meta-populations in Central China (Hebei, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, northern Henan) and South-West China (western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions) (Laguardia <em>et al.</em> 2017, Vitekere<em> et al.</em> 2021, Wang<em> et al. </em>2021). About 96–98 % of the North Chinese leopard habitat has been lost compared to historical conditions (Xie <em>et al.</em> 2018) and it is listed Chinese National Class I Key Protected Wildlife (Song <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Loess Plateau is the core distribution area of North China leopard with the largest and densest population in the remaining forests of the Ziwuling Mountains in the central part of the region (Yang<em> et al. </em>2021). In Tieqiaoshan Provincial Nature Reserve (Shanxi province) the recapturing model estimates that the population density of North China leopard in 2017–2019 was high enough—4.23 per 100 km² (Zhu<em> et al.</em> 2021). The microsatellite results of 22 DNA identified leopards in Loess Plateau (Yin <em>et al. </em>2023) showed significant genetic differentiation of populations on both sides of the Yellow River. Leopards from Tieqiaoshan Provincial Nature Reserve in the Shanxi province (North from Yellow River) showed a significantly lower genetic diversity and a severe inbreeding decline compared to animals from Ziwuling Nature Reserve (Shaanxi Province) and Liupanshan Nature Reserve (Ningxia Province). Yellow River with its wide belt of converted lands is the main cause of the divergence of the original North China leopard populations and they should be set up into two conservation management units, between which there are no direct ecological corridor connection (Yin <em>et al. </em>2023). Across Central China subpopulations are small (&lt;50 individuals) and fragmented, and occur mainly in isolated nature reserves, indicating some subpopulations may not be viable in the long-term. Reasons for their decline include retaliatory killings due to conflict, poaching for wildlife trade, low prey numbers (especially ungulates), genetic inbreeding, habitat loss and fragmentation (Laguardia<em> et al. </em>2017, Vitekere<em> et al. </em>2021, Paijmans<em> et al. </em>2021).<br/><br/><u><strong>Indochinese Leopard </strong>(classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. delacouri</em>):</u> The most recent review showed an even greater reduction in range for Leopards in South-east Asia (Rostro-García<em> et al. </em>2019). This subspecies is now likely extinct in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Singapore, with strongholds remaining in Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand (Rostro-Garcia pers. comm. 2023). Populations persist in border forests in Thailand and southern China, including both Yunnan in the southwest and southeastern China, resulting in a total estimated population &lt;114-1,130 individuals for all of Southeast Asia (Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2019). Targeted poaching for wildlife trade and snaring for bushmeat remain the greatest factor that contributed to the recent range collapse of Leopards in South-east Asia. Leopard parts are used as substitutes for Tiger parts for medicinal purposes in China and South-east Asia, and Leopard skins are highly sought after as luxury items (Rostro-Garcia<em> et al. </em>2023). Poachers in South-east Asia can get up to $3,000 for a Leopard carcass (S. Prum and R. Maharjan pers. comms. 2014), and this price likely will continue to increase. Other important factors include depletion of prey base, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout all South-east Asian countries and southeastern China, primate and large (&gt;5 kg) ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Johnson <em>et al. </em>2006, Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014), which may hinder recovery of Leopards in the region. Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to Leopards in South-east Asia, particularly because these are closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. The deforestation rate in South-east Asia is the highest of all tropical regions, and the rate is still increasing (Sodhi <em>et al. </em>2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). From 2000 to 2010, areas of primary or secondary forests decreased in all Southeast Asian countries, most of which was due to conversion to palm oil and rubber plantations, as the price of these commodities increased 130% and 333%, respectively, during the same period (Wilcove <em>et al.</em> 2013). Because &lt;10% of South-east Asian forests are under some form of protection, and prices of luxury wood, palm oil, and rubber are expected to increase, habitat loss in the region is expected to continue (Sodhi <em>et al. </em>2010) and thus likely to have negative impacts on the leopard populations. The Indochinese Leopard (<em>P. p. delacouri</em>) is assessed as Critically Endangered under A2b+3b+4b (Rostro-García <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/><u><strong>Persian Leopard</strong> (<em>P. p. tulliana</em>)</u>: The entire Leopard population in this region is estimated to be around 750–1,044 individuals (Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023) with around 83% of which (528–732) in Iran (Farhadinia<em> et al.</em> 2022, Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2022). The largest continuous Leopard hotspot across Asia occurs in Northern Iran and Central Asia which is estimated between 348–440 individuals (Farhardinia<em> et al.</em> 2022). Around 60–80 individuals are estimated to be in the Kopetdag region of Turkmenistan (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2022). The current population of leopards in Kazakhstan varies between 0 and 5 (Red Book of Endangered Species, Kazakhstan 2021). The minimum population identified in the South Caucasus from camera trap images is 6–17 (including 3–9 cubs) in Azerbaijan and 3–9 in Armenia (Khorozyan<em> et al. </em>2022). In Iraqi Kurdistan, the nine adult individuals are identified (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2023). At the site level, Tandoureh and Golestan national parks in Iran with 30 and 20 adult detected individuals detected from camera traps, respectively, hold the largest populations of Persian Leopards across the entire range (Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2022, Hamidi <em>et al.</em> 2014). The western range of Persian leopard lays along Zagros Mountains spanning between Iran, Iraq and Turkey, but often in smaller populations, varying between 1.0-1.9 leopard/100 km² in density (Ghoddousi<em> et al. </em>2010, Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2021). Other protected areas in Iran with the extant population of Persian Leopard identified through camera trapping or DNA fingerprinting include Dena National Park (18 individuals), Salouk National Park (11), Bamu National Park (5–11), Sarigol National (10), Kiasar National Park (10), Bafq Protected Area (5–8), North Alborz Protected Area (7), Parvar Protected Area (7), and Bakhtegan National Park (6) (Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2021, 2022; Ghoddousi <em>et al. </em>2010, 2022 ). The density of Leopards in northeastern Iran was reported to vary between 2.63 and 8.86 individuals/100 km² (Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2019, Hamidi <em>et al.</em> 2014). Moreover, 18 individuals (2015–2019) had been identified in unprotected lands in the East of Hormozgan Province, Iran (Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2022) but a follow-up camera trap survey revealed the persistence of only 11 individuals and at least three Leopards killed due to conflict (M. Arianejad pers. comm. 2021). Overall Persian Leopard populations estimates are not available due to four decades of unrest in Afghanistan. Records from retaliatory killing and other random trapping records by impacted communities indicate the presence of a substantial number and a widespread distribution of Leopards in Afghanistan (Ostrowski <em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/><strong>Other subspecies</strong>: Leopards of the Arabian Peninsula (<em>P. p. nimr </em>requires listing as Critically Endangered due to low population numbers and population fragmentation. The Arabian Leopard is assessed as Critically Endangered under C2a(i) with only 70–84 mature individuals remaining in two main subpopulations in Oman and Yemen (Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023). The subpopulations in Oman and Yemen each only contain around 50 mature individuals and are severely fragmented and declining (Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023). The Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) is assessed as Vulnerable under D1 with a declining population. The Javan Leopard (<em>P. p. melas</em>), is listed as Endangered (but very close to Critically Endangered) under C2a(i) with only 319 mature individuals left, less than 50 mature individuals in each subpopulation and with a continuously declining population (Wibisono<em> et al. </em>2021). <br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> We acknowledge that additional data could reveal an increase or decrease in population size or range loss of Leopards, thus the status could change for segments of Leopard range as more data are collected."
22693447,"Buff-breasted Sandpiper is suspected to have undergone a moderately rapid to rapid decline which is thought to be driven by habitat loss in non-breeding and/or migratory stopover sites, but changes in breeding habitat due to climate change may also be affecting populations. Rapid to very rapid reductions have been detected from a large network of migration sites in North America, which may reflect a significant reduction in reproductive success. But a decline has also been recorded across large-scale sampling surveys of the breeding range in Alaska. The precision of rate estimates may be poor due to the species’ low side fidelity and annual variation in stopover sites, but there appears reasonable evidence to support that a concerning decline is underway. Greater survey effort has resulted in the population size being revised upwards considerably, hence the species is not believed to be at risk due a small population size at present. Due to the likely rate of population reduction, Buff-breasted Sandpiper is assessed as Vulnerable. <p></p>","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. Several symposia have been held and the Buff-breasted Sandpiper Conservation Working Group has been formed to identify priority actions and bring together individuals and organisations involved in conservation action and research for the species (Anon. 2020). A conservation plan was prepared for the species in 2010 that lists priority actions for the species (Lanctot <em>et al</em>. 2010). Intensive field surveys are on-going in Texas and Nebraska, and a range-wide tracking study is underway to document migration routes and key staging, breeding and wintering locations (Lanctot <em>et al. </em>2016). Intensive range management and site conservation are underway in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Bolivia.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Implement priority actions identified in the Buff-breasted Sandpiper Conservation plan and the 2015 symposium. Ascertain the population size and trend for the species. &#160;Identify migration routes and conserve key breeding, staging and wintering locations. Investigate the quality of foraging habitat and&#160;further investigate the influence of contaminants in agricultural areas used during migration (McCarty <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009) and while wintering (Strum <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010).","This species breeds in the high Arctic on well drained tundra with tussocks and scant vegetation. It is generally not found near the sea and avoids inundated marshes. It appears to depend heavily upon intensive grazing by livestock in its wintering grounds to create short grassland (Lanctot <em>et al.</em> 2002, Aldabe 2016)<strong></strong>, but also uses flooded pampas grasslands (Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lanctot <em>et al</em>. 2004). During migration it is found on many short grass habitats (McCarty <em>et al</em>. 2009, Norling <em>et al</em>. 2012), and appears to have developed a strong association with turf farms in Texas (R. Lanctot <em>in litt. </em>2024). At the internationally important Rainwater Basin stopover site in Nebraska, U.S.A., it was observed to feed primarily in agricultural land (soybeans, corn), and use wetlands for resting (McCarty <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). It is a lekking species.<br/>Throughout the non-breeding range and along the species’ migration route the area of suitable natural short grass habitat has decreased enormously since the 1800s and is continuing to be converted to agricultural cropland (Lanctot <em>et al. </em>2010). While the species has adapted to using a variety of agricultural land that provides short grass habitat (<em>c.</em> 5-8 cm tall, R. Lanctot <em>in litt. </em>2024), the increasing conversion to row crops and subsequent intensification of management (Piquer-Rodriguez <em>et al.</em> 2018) is inferred to result in an ongoing decline in habitat area and quality. The rapid conversion of savannah to oil palm and rice cultivation in the Colombian Llanos (Romero-Ruiz <em>et al. </em>2011) undoubtedly reduces the quality and likely the area of habitat available in this key pre-breeding migration staging area (Lanctot <em>et al. </em>2016, Fink<em> et al.</em> 2023).<p></p>","This species was targeted by market hunters in the 19th century, noted to have caused a significant population reduction in the species (McCarty <em>et al. </em>2020) although a genetic investigation showed no evidence of a population bottleneck from this time (Lounsberry <em>et al. </em>2014). The species is rare in countries that still harvest large numbers of shorebirds and does not feature in harvest index assessments (AFSI 2020). However on Barbados they are sometimes inadvertently harvested despite being protected by the 1907 Barbados Wild Birds Protection Act, which makes hunting the species illegal (Wege <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;A review of global trade recorded a low incidence of ongoing trade, with the species being found in one of the seven trade datasets evaluated (Donald <em>et al.</em> 2024). A Potential Biological Removal estimate was generated for the species at&#160;921 to 1,847 mature individuals (Watts <em>et al. </em>2015), a low value but not currently expected to be approached.","Habitat loss in the non-breeding and migratory stopover sites is likely to be one of or the primary drivers of population reductions. The species has proved able to adapt to the conversion of natural grassland to grazed pasture and in migratory stopover sites also uses tilled cropland, including soy beans and corn fields (McCarty <em>et al. </em>2020). However, the ongoing conversion of grazed land to crops within the limited non-breeding area and subsequent intensification of agricultural management of that land (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Piquer-Rodriguez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, COSEWIC 2021) is thought to be at sufficient intensity to be causing population impacts. Changes in grazing regime that result in taller vegetation reduce the area of suitable foraging habitat (Lanctot <em>et al. </em>2010). <br/>The Llanos grasslands, a key pre-breeding migration stopover site (Garcia-Ruiz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Lanctot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016), are rapidly being converted to oil palm and rice in Colombia (Romero-Ruiz&#160;<em>et al. </em>2011), which are unsuitable habitats for this species. <br/><br/>Habitat shifting caused by climate change is a severe future threat that is considered likely to result in a decline in habitat availability, although current predictions are uncertain (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2024). What has been demonstrated is that the species is already being lost from some study areas near the south of the breeding range (Andersen <em>et al. </em>2023), and rapid changes in abundance at some sites appear driven by shifts in the range, noting that the species breeds to the northward limit of land. Using a species distribution model approach Wauchope <em>et al. </em>(2017) predicted that under future climate change scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 Buff-breasted Sandpiper would lose around 50% of climatically suitable breeding habitat by 2070. Climate change may also affect the species during migration by increasing the severity of storms over the western Atlantic that could directly impact survival rates of juveniles, which predominately use this pathway during southbound migration (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The species was severely overhunted in the late 1800s and the early part of the 1900s, reportedly declining to near extinction from a population which may have numbered in the hundreds of thousands to millions (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, McCarty&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Current hunting mortality is poorly known but not thought to be significant and is unlikely to be close to the Potential Biological Removal value set at 921 to 1,847 mature individuals (Watts&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, McCarty <em>et al. </em>2020). Hunting mortality does continue in Barbados, though this species is taken inadvertently from mixed flocks and it is strictly protected in the country (Wege <em>et al. </em>2014). This species is rare in the areas where high levels of shorebird hunting have been recorded recently and is not considered to be at significant risk (AFSI 2020).<br/><br/>Exposure on migration to toxic chemicals and pollutants in its agricultural feeding grounds may pose a threat (McCarty <em>et al. </em>2020). There is evidence that individuals are exposed to cholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides in rice and cattle pastures in Argentina and Paraguay, which affect the birds' physiology (Strum <em>et al. </em>2010)&#160;and may reduce individual condition sufficiently to result in carry over effects on migration and the subsequent breeding season. High levels of chemicals are applied in the turf farms that are now heavily favoured by the species at stopover sites sites along the Gulf of Mexico (R. Lanctot <em>in litt. </em>2024, McCarty <em>et al. </em>2020); any population impact of these is uncertain. There has also not been any assessment of the impacts of new classes of agricultural chemicals, such as neonicotinoids (Gibbons <em>et al. </em>2015).","The global population has most recently been estimated at 550,000 individuals (Bart <em>et al.</em> in prep.). This value is based on the final estimate from the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys on the breeding grounds (Bart and Smith 2012, Smith <em>et al.</em> in prep.). The final estimate for Arctic Canada was 568,395 individuals (95% CI 358,000-654,000) (Smith <em>et al.</em> in prep.), with an additional 42,588 (5,856-79,260) individuals in Alaska (ECCC 2021, Smith<em> et al.</em> in prep.), giving a total of 610,983 individuals (364,000-733,000). The entire Canada and USA range was included within the sampled area (Smith <em>et al.</em> in prep.). These surveys target breeding pairs in suitable breeding habitat, hence the values derived are considered to relate to mature individuals. However, this estimate has been derived from a low number of survey plots and the habitat strata to which densities are applied are coarse (R. Lanctot <em>in litt. </em>(2024). For this species, which has a lek mating system and fine-scale habitat selection, densities can be highly variable and unpredictable making extrapolations based on habitat association potentially misleading (ECCC 2021). These concerns are emphasised by the low number of observations on which final numbers are based: only 60 observations produced the Alaskan estimate (Smith <em>et al. </em>in prep.), hence the very wide confidence intervals. The previous population estimate was 56,000 individuals (Lanctot<em> et al. </em>2010, Andres&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), from a range of 23,000 (Jorgensen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008) to 84,000 individuals (Norling <em>et al. </em>2012), later refined to 35,000-78,000 by Andres <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2012).&#160;Numbers in non-breeding areas also suggest a much smaller population than that generated by the PRISM surveys, or that a large proportion of this breeding population are unaccounted for by surveys to date (McCarty <em>et al.</em> 2020). Surveys of the non-breeding population in southern Brazil recorded approximately 3,400 individuals (Faria <em>et al. </em>2023): this is a small proportion of the main wintering area.<br/>Given the uncertainty, the population is here placed in a wide range and the best value is considered to fall below that estimated from the PRISM surveys. It seems likely that the true population size is considerably larger than the 56,000 previously estimated. Using the upper bound of the previous values, 84,000 (derived from a single season extrapolation of counts of spring migrants in Texas [Norling <em>et al. </em>2012]) as a minimum seems actually precautionary: a long stopover duration was used in this calculation where the true value is likely shorter, and shorter stopovers mean that a greater number of individuals have passed through to study area (ECCC 2021). Similarly, estimates from Nebraska's Rainwater Basin of 43,300 (Jorgenson <em>et al. </em>2008) were based on a longer stopover duration than later estimated at the site (McCarty 2015) and a greater number of individuals likely passed through the site. It is also important to note that a proportion of the population skip these sites, further suggesting the population size considerably exceeds the reported value. Considering the various data, the population is here placed in a band of between 84,000-364,000, representing the minimum number based on extrapolation of counts at spring staging locations (Norling <em>et al. </em>2012) and the low bound of the estimate based on the PRISM surveys (Smith <em>et al. </em>in prep.).<br/>The population today is considered to have been greatly reduced from historic levels due to 19th century market hunting and the loss of much short-grass prairie from North America (McCarty <em>et al. </em>2020)."
2888,"Banteng is considered Critically Endangered (A2abcd+4cd) due to an estimated ongoing global population decline of &gt;80% over the past ~21 years (generation-length estimated to be seven years). This decline is likely to continue hence listing under both A2 and A4. <br/><br/> Dramatic declines have been estimated for most subpopulations across the species’ range, including for the former largest global stronghold in Cambodia. Declines are primarily driven by illegal hunting for meat and trade in horns, by-catch in traps set for other species, and extensive habitat loss and degradation in mainland southeast Asia, Sabah, and Kalimantan. Deaths and injuries due to increasing levels of snaring are placing high pressure on remnant populations across most of the species’ geographical range.<br/><br/> Long-term monitoring of Banteng within three protected areas (8,920 km<sup>2</sup>) in Eastern Cambodia show a twelve-year population decline of <em>c</em>. 90% (Groenenberg <em>et al.</em> 2023), with an estimated three-generation decline of 94–99%. We assumed these rates of declines were representative for other areas of suitable Banteng habitat in the wider Eastern Plains Landscape Cambodia (&gt;10,000-km<sup>2</sup>). In the Northern Plains of Cambodia, the three-generation population decline rate was estimated at 90%. The three-generation rate of decline for most other subpopulations were estimated to be lower than those in Cambodia. For Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Kalimantan, and Myanmar, the rates were all over 50% (weighted mean rate of decline 70% for these four locations). Despite equal or higher illegal hunting levels in these countries compared to Cambodia, the initial population size was much smaller which leads to a lower overall magnitude of change. On Sabah, intrinsic population growth rates were estimated using population models and accounting for an annual harvest rate (i.e. illegal hunting) of 4% (Gardner <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021) (three-generation rate of decline was between 12–46%). Assuming an offtake rate of 5%, all Sabah populations were estimated to become extinct within a 39 year timeframe (Gardner <em>et al</em>. 2021). The population recovery of Banteng populations in some parts of Thailand, especially in the Western Forest Complex, resulted in a net positive nation-wide population trend despite declines and extirpations in other parts of the country. The population trend in most national parks in Java is assumed stable. The estimated 3-generation global population decline rate (weighted by the estimated population sizes in 2003) is just over 80%.<br/><br/> The current total global population is estimated at approximately 3,300 mature individuals (2,475–4,900). A three-generation global decline rate of 80% would have required a 2003 global population size of <em>c</em>. 16,500 mature individuals. High quality habitat with relatively low hunting levels (such as seen in some areas in Eastern Cambodia between 2010–2014) can have densities of <em>c</em>. two Banteng/km<sup>2</sup> (Groenenberg <em>et al. </em>2020). As such, 16,500 Banteng would have required ≥8,250 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat which is plausible.","This species is legally protected in all range states. A proposal for inclusion into CITES Appendix I was submitted (Hedges 1996), however, there have been no developments and the species is not currently listed.<br/> <br/> The most significant known Banteng populations remaining are in Java, Cambodia, Thailand, and Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), and it is in these countries and around these populations that conservation efforts should be focused.<br/> <br/> Banteng is mainly confined to protected areas throughout South-east Asia (see Population). Unfortunately, in most protected areas of Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Cambodia which still retain Banteng, protected status offers little if any protection to the species (Groenenberg <em>et al.</em>2023, Nuttall <em>et al.&#160;</em>2022). The immediate conservation needs are to continue strengthening site-based conservation management to reduce anthropogenic threats within and around core Banteng range areas. Improvements should include the strengthening of law enforcement to reduce all forms of hunting and unplanned habitat conversion as well as more effective engagement with local communities (Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2015, Wright <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Belecky&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). <span class=""cf01"">Identification of existing populations and distribution across Cambodia is crucial to ensuring all populations and conserved and managed accordingly. Conservation breeding and translocation programmes may now be necessary to support population recovery in well protected areas and the feasibility of such programme is currently being assessed for Siem Pang Wildlife Sanctuary, Cambodia (J. Lyon pers. comm. November 2023). <br/><br/> The recovering population trend of several Thai Banteng populations is probably attributed to a combination of factors including: (1) the effects of decades of conservation outreach, media attention, and education that has increased ethical and conservation concerns for wildlife, and shifted social norms and cultural values away from hunting (Steinmetz <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, GlobeScan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021); (2) a shift in local hunting practices, which tend to target small wildlife species rather than large ungulates (Phumanee <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020); (3) improved law enforcement (Duangchantrasiri <em>et al</em>. 2016); (4) effective logging bans (R. Chaiyarat pers. comm. 2024); and (5) habitat management targeted at ungulates, particularly the creation of grasslands, saltlicks, and water sources which can increase population growth rates of ungulates (Fryxell <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Law enforcement in conjunction with local stakeholder engagement is essential to tackle poaching (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, 2014; Jornburom&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Maintaining and expanding suitable habitat and connectivity between fragmented populations will be essential for gene flow and long-term population viability (Trisurat&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Suksawat <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Phoonjampa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021). Successful Banteng reintroductions have occurred in Salakphra WS and, in conjunction with careful genetic management of both the source and wild stock, proved an effective conservation strategy to prevent extinction (Phoonjampa <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, Chaiyarat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023b). <br/><br/> Java has highly fragmented natural habitats and has done for centuries, reflecting longstanding high human population densities. Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of NPs and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' NPs and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""game reserves"" and ""Nature Reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other off-take, but the NPs of Java (several of which contain ideal habitat for Banteng and, at least into the mid 1990s, large populations) remained remarkably close to intact for much of the period. During the 1980s and early to mid 1990s guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. The strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some smaller mammals, through various forms of trapping, including snaring. Thus there was relatively little hunting of Banteng and populations were stable or even increasing. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the people's resources and would therefore benefit from decentralised management (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ‘tragedy of the commons’, has indeed led to increased destruction and poaching in the past two decades. <br/><br/> The Directorate of Species and Genetic Biodiversity Conservation (KKHSG) and the Indonesian Zoo Association (PKBSI) are leading the Javan Banteng metapopulation management approach through the Action Indonesia Global Species Management Plan (GSMPs), which aims to coordinate cooperation between national and international conservation institutions to increase <em>ex situ</em> and <em>in situ</em> populations. Currently, Javan Banteng metapopulation management activities are being carried out in four NPs, namely Baluran NP, Alas Purwo NP, Meru Betiri NP, and Ujung Kulon NP, to understand the current population conditions in each park and maximize genetic diversity in each subpopulation. Conservation actions have included two years of park wide camera trap monitoring in Alas Purwo NP, long term monitoring for Banteng in Baluran NP, and work with Ujung Kulon and Meru Betiri NPs to align Banteng data for a consistent monitoring method. Conducting systematic and consistent surveys across the Banteng home range using robust methods (such as camera trapping with Random Encounter Model) is recommended. In 2023 and 2024, the four parks are working together to conduct biopsy sampling on Banteng individuals in order to identify their genetic diversity. This programme is expected to improve island-wide management of Banteng in Java as a unitary population to allow the wild population to increase.<br/><br/> The Sabah Wildlife Department published the Bornean Banteng Action Plan for Sabah 2019–2028 in 2018 (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). The seven major non site-specific priority objectives include: law enforcement and patrolling to combat the poaching threat; to establish a captive breeding and cryopreservation programme in Sabah in order to conserve the remnant genetic diversity and increase numbers for future reintroduction; to maintain suitable habitat for Bantengs and prevent further loss and degradation; to establish and maintain landscape connectivity throughout the range of Banteng in Sabah; to conduct research on hunting prevalence and trends; to provide education and raise awareness with relevant stakeholders in the vicinity of protected areas; to establish an Endangered Species Conservation Unit that will monitor the implementation of the action/conservation plans. Further site-specific priority actions are also identified for each of the four management units.<br/><br/> A large feral population of Banteng exists in the northern territories of Australia, however, this is thought to be derived from Bali cattle (Bradshaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Three zoological associations manage <em>ex situ</em> populations of Banteng (<em>Bos javanicus javanicus</em>). The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (population size = 20), the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums (population size = 108), and the Indonesian Zoo Association (PKBSI; population size = 65). They all participate in a Global Species Management Plan to cooperatively manage the species at global level to ensure long-term demographic and genetic viability.","Wharton (1968) summarized information about Banteng habitat from throughout its range and he concluded that on the Asian mainland it avoids evergreen forest and even extensive tracts of closed canopy semi-evergreen forest, and is usually within more open dry deciduous forests; but within the more humid areas of Java and Borneo it occupies secondary forest formations resulting from logging and fires, and enters tracts of sub-humid forest on occasion. On the eastern plains of Cambodia, there is no evidence for any change in ecology. In Thailand, reintroduced Banteng prefer low elevation, with flat terrain at further distances from villages and without human disturbance (Chaiyarat <em>et al</em>. 2019b, 2018) but it has been found higher than 1,700 m in Thung Yai Naresuan (West) Wildlife Sanctuary. In Myanmar, Banteng is reported to prefer flat or undulating terrain with light deciduous (particularly dipterocarp indaing forest) or mixed deciduous and evergreen forest, with grassy glades which burn annually, and patches of bamboo; but it has purportedly retreated to denser hill forest in the face of advancing cultivation. (Peacock 1933, Tun Yin 1967,&#160;Wharton 1968, Prater 1971). Similarly in Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and Lao PDR, Banteng occurs (or occurred) in open mainly deciduous forest with glades, parklands, and dense forest patches; and ‘it is claimed by some that they prefer rocky, slightly hilly country, but they are certainly at home wherever the Kouprey [<em>Bos sauveli</em>] was found. Their range in Cambodia (and elsewhere in South-east Asia) suggests that Banteng are more adaptable than Kouprey and perhaps less exacting in their habitat requirements’ (Wharton 1957, 1968). An attachment to open, more deciduous forest types was reported in Xe Pian National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Steinmetz 2004). The documented and reported distribution of the species in Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam (based on many sources, but principally summarised in Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999 and AWCSG 2011) quite clearly corresponds in large part to the distribution of deciduous dipterocarp forest, but also includes other habitats especially mosaic habitats that include open-canopy formations and grasslands, including for example pine forests. In Thailand, Banteng have been associated with mixed deciduous forest and even agricultural areas (Chaiyarat <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Jornburom <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). In contrast there is a clear paucity of records of Banteng from extensive tracts of closed canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, with no records from the heart of any such dense forests. The supposition that it might prefer rocky, slightly hilly country has not been borne out by recent observations. In the Eastern Plains Landscape, Cambodia, Gray (2012), based on analysis of camera-trap records, considered that Banteng occurred in both very open deciduous dipterocarp forest and denser mixed deciduous forest. It was also suggested that, in the largely homogenous deciduous dipterocarp forest of the Cambodian Eastern Plains Landscape small patches of mixed deciduous forest are important for Banteng at the height of the dry and burning seasons. <br/><br/> On Java Banteng occurs in semi-deciduous monsoon forest with small clearings, more open grassland-monsoon forest mosaics, and ‘parkland’ formations (Halder 1976, Hommel 1987; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 based on unpubl. data 1991–2002). Banteng in Ujung Kulon NP prefer forests in lowland areas with high primary productivity of food sources towards the centre of the park (Rahman 2020, Rahman<em> et al.&#160;</em>2019). On Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) Banteng inhabits tropical lowland and upland dipterocarp forest, lower montane forest, seasonal freshwater swamp forest and beach forest (Melletti and Burton 2014). It also uses open grassland, mature timber plantations (seven years), and abandoned cultivated land. Suitable habitat is associated with specific soil types, is within or close to intact or logged forests with pioneer vegetation and accessible terrain, and in areas with relatively higher precipitation in the driest quarter of the year (Lim<em> et al</em>. 2021). Forest edges, interior openings, abandoned logging roads and river banks are important for foraging, socialising and movement (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Gardner 2015). Human disturbance heavily influences habitat use. In forest habitat that is mature, Banteng travels to interior grassy openings within the forest to forage or travel to the forest edge to forage during undisturbed hours (Gardner 2015). <br/><br/> Banteng generally occurs from sea level up to at least 2,100 m asl (Hoogerwerf 1970, National Research Council 1983, Pudyatmoko 2004; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 based on unpubl. data 1991–2002). The observed maximum elevation of Banteng in Sabah is approximately 1,330m asl. (P. Gardner pers. obs.).<br/> <br/> Banteng reportedly drinks large quantities of water and prefers feeding grounds near a permanent water supply (Hoogerwerf 1970). When conditions are favourable it drinks daily, preferring standing water; but during droughts animals can survive several days without drinking (National Research Council 1983). Mineral licks are also an important feature of Banteng habitat; in coastal regions which lack mineral licks animals seem to meet their mineral requirements by occasionally drinking seawater (Halder 1976, Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Alikodra 1987; S. Hedges pers. obs.).<br/><br/> Although probably a grazer by preference Banteng should perhaps be considered an intermediate feeder since it can and does consume a lot of browse and fruits depending on season and local food availability. It eats grasses, sedges, herbs, bamboo, as well as the leaves, fruits, flowers, bark, and young branches of woody shrubs and trees including palms. The young shoots of Alang-alang grass <em>Imperata cylindrica&#160;</em>are apparently a favoured food source (Hoogerwerf 1970). Lists of food plants are provided by Wharton (1957), Hoogerwerf (1970), Halder (1976), Sumardja and Kartawinata (1977), Djaja <em>et al</em>. (1982), Alikodra (1987), Prayurasiddhi and Smith (1993). However, very little is known about the Banteng’s nutritional requirements, seasonal and annual variation in dietary preferences, or the composition and quality of diet. Hoogerwerf (1970) believed that Banteng was largely dependent on grasses and sedges and, with reference to Ujung Kulon in West Java, he stated that ‘there were no proofs that browse formed a substantial part of the diet’. However, Schenkel and Schenkel-Hulliger (1969) reported that Banteng and deer in Ujung Kulon are forced to travel widely in the dry season and ‘feed on bamboo, young palm leaves, bush, and saplings as well’. A recent study showed that Banteng supplement their diet with the invasive Cluster Sugar Palm <em>Arenga obtusifolia</em> during the lean dry season (Rahman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The stomachs of a number of bulls which were shot in the South Tjiandur region of Java were almost completely full of non-graminaceous species. In Pananjung-Pangandaran Reserve in West Java Banteng were observed to graze on a variety of plants but appeared to prefer the grasses <em>Ischaemum muticum, Axonopus compressus, Paspalum conjugatum,</em> and <em>Cynodon dactylon</em>; and a woody forest shrub. Grazing intensity was lower in the forest than in the open fields where it was inversely proportional to the amount of <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>&#160;[was <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>] and <em>Imperata cylindrica&#160;</em>although they did eat these species (Sumardja and Kartawinata 1977). On Sabah, Banteng was found to forage on eight species found within open canopy sites: <em>Mikania cordata</em>,&#160;<em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, <em>Cyperus difformis</em>, <em>Fimbristylis littoralis</em>, <em>Scleria</em> sp.,&#160;<em>Desmodium triflorum</em> [now <em>Gona triflora</em>], <em>Eleusine indica</em>, and <em>Selaginella</em> sp. (Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2019a).<br/><br/> When undisturbed, Banteng displays a more or less fixed diurnal pattern of behaviour with periods (usually two to three hours long) of feeding alternating with rest periods of a similar length during which the animals ruminate. In areas which are subject to frequent human disturbance it becomes rather nocturnal and generally enters open areas only at night, although in especially attractive localities it will tolerate human presence to a certain extent (Halder 1976). In undisturbed areas Bantengs “do not differentiate much in their activities between day and night, but...really large assemblages on open plains occur almost exclusively by day...”. This round the clock activity (which is, however, interrupted countless times to rest and/or ruminate) may not be regarded as abnormal’ (Hoogerwerf 1970: 211–212).<br/><br/> In undisturbed forest habitat in Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) Banteng activity peaks at dawn and during the early morning hours of 05:00–07:00 hours when the animals emerge from the forest to forage and socialise. Activity decreases mid-morning until early afternoon when they rest and ruminate and at dusk, a second peak in activity occurs during which they forage and socialise (Gardner <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2019a). Banteng activity decreases around 20:00–21:00 hours and again at 03:00-04:00; the reasons for this are unknown (Melletti and Burton 2014, Gardner 2015). Analysis of 160 Banteng camera-trap encounters from the Cambodian Eastern Plains showed nocturnal activity with over 80% of encounters between 18:00 and 06:00 hours (Gray and Phan 2011).<br/> <br/> The basic social group appears to be female–juvenile unit (as in the other large Asian Bovini) with larger groups tending to be more-or-less temporary assemblages. Maternal herds containing several adult cows, juveniles, and calves occur; these groups can often contain one or more subadult and adult males. Groups of cows without calves are also seen. For much of the year (adult) Bantengs are largely sexually segregated and all-male groups are frequently encountered at this time. Solitary animals tend to be mature bulls or sometimes old cows. The composition of small groups of cows with calves or juveniles, and the solitary state of old individuals may remain the same for months or even years. The composition of other small groups, particularly the unisex groups, usually varies from day to day. During the mating season the male groups disband and dominant males compete for access to receptive females (Hoogerwerf 1970, Halder 1976; S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991–2002). In large open areas small herds of Banteng and solitary individuals regularly gather to form large temporary assemblages. These large herds will often spend up to two days together during which time they will forage and ruminate, socialise, and re-establish their hierarchy.<br/><br/> Large herds of more than 100 animals have been reported in Java but these herds appear to be temporary associations formed when smaller groups and solitary animals arrive in an area to feed and the animals tend to reform into smaller groups when they leave the feeding areas. The composition of these groups often varies on a daily basis although there may be a stable nucleus of animals which returns to the same clearing day after day. The large herds may have an established dominance hierarchy but it seems to vary depending on the habitat. In more densely vegetated areas solitary animals or small groups, generally with fewer than eight animals, are more typical (Halder 1973, 1976; S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991–2002). In the Eastern Plains Landscape, Cambodia, mean Banteng herd size (estimated from counting individuals in independent camera-trap encounters) was 2.6 individuals with 14% of encounters estimated to comprise groups of more than five individuals (Phan and Gray 2010).<br/> <br/> In Thailand the mating season is in May and June (Lekagul and McNeely 1977); while breeding reportedly occurs the whole year round in Myanmar (Peacock 1933). Wharton (1957) collected information from Cambodians living within Banteng habitat which suggested that the majority of births occurred in December and January which, assuming a gestation period of about 10 months, suggests that most conceptions take place in March and April. However, Hermanns (cited in Hoogerwerf 1970) believed that Bantengs in mainland Asia mate from September to October. Hoogerwerf (1970) recorded mating taking place all year round in West Java but there was a peak of activity in October; and he thought that those cows which mated outside the peak period were probably exceptional. He suggested that Bantengs in both East and West Java generally calved in July and August which would suggest that mating generally took place from October to December; more recent observations in East Java have also revealed evidence of year-round mating (neonates have been seen in all months) but with an apparent peak of births between June and September (S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991–2002).","The Banteng is hunted for food, traditional medicinal substances, sport, and trophy horns. A growing regional and domestic economy has led to an increase in the demand for natural resources, Banteng amongst them, and the potential benefits of hunting Banteng with possibilities of significant market value must make it a lucrative target.<br/><br/> The magnitude of the threat posed to Banteng by international trade in trophy horns is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, given the small size of the remaining population and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, during what were essentially opportunistic surveys, it was clearly a major threat on the Asian mainland (Srikosamatara <em>et al.</em>&#160;1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong <em>et al.</em> 1997; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999; Timmins and Ou 2001). The threat posed by use of traditional medicinal substances derived from wild oxen is even harder to determine in the case of Banteng and essentially remains unknown, although it is thought to be a source of significant threat (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2008). Occasionally Banteng horns can be found at local markets on Sabah and their use is thought to be for soups (believed to increase general vitality) (Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reports suggest an international trade in trophy heads originating from Kalimantan and sold across the Sabah border however first-hand accounts have yet to be substantiated. Local informants reported at least 24 Banteng killed between 1950–2015 in Belantikan Hulu on central Kalimantan, likely a representing a vast underestimation of the true number (Dewi <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/> The widespread consumption of wild cattle meat in logging camps during the 1980s and 1990s in the West, Central and Northeast regions of Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) is well documented (Kleinschroth and Healey 2017). Timber roads subsequently opened up previously remote forests, contributing to a further increase in poaching pressure (Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2021). Banteng poaching remains widespread on Sabah to date, although quantifying its exact extent is challenging as the majority of incidents remains unreported. Social media postings and occasional news paper reports provide photographic evidence of poaching incidents. In recent years, pictures of hunters with Banteng carcasses emerged from Sipitang, Tabin, Maliau Basin Conservation Area and Ulu-Segama (Sabah Wildlife Department, 2019). The true number of successful Banteng hunts are known to be much higher due to the number of reports obtained from locals and timber contractors, the high frequency of photographic captures of hunters, and the reports of intimidation of forest rangers by military personnel and officials conducting sport hunting within protected forests. <br/><br/> There are a number of captive animals within zoos and other menageries, but these constitute an insignificant offtake in recent years from wild populations.<br/> <br/> There is a domesticated form of Banteng, but its uses supply needs/markets independent of those supplied by wild caught animals.","Illegal hunting is the most pressing threat in much of the current southeast Asia Banteng range and is largely driven by a growing demand for wild meat consumption (Harrison <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Ripple <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Common hunting methods include the use of domestic dogs, firearms, and snares, and it is the latter that is likely to have the most devastating impact on Banteng (Gray <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Belecky and Gray, 2020). Approximately 53,000 snares were removed per year from 11 protected areas alone in five Southeast Asian countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Viet Nam) in the period between 2005–2019 (Belecky and Gray 2020). Protected areas in Cambodia have experienced steep increases in snares over the past 5–10 years (Gish<em> et al.&#160;</em>2021, Groenenberg <em>et al.&#160;</em>2023, Rostro-García <em>et al.&#160;</em>2023).<br/><br/> Forest clearance and fragmentation also pose a significant threat to Banteng persistence across most of its range. In Viet Nam and Lao PDR, where the rate of lowland forest loss is also accelerating habitat loss, this is primarily a concern for the future viability of national populations, the species having been hunted out of forests long before they are cleared. In Indochina generally, habitat loss and fragmentation are secondary to hunting, largely acting indirectly by increasing accessibility of remnant Banteng populations to hunting. Although huge tracts of suitable habitat were lost in the twentieth century, and continue to be converted, this has probably occurred largely after Banteng was hunted out (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Thus, the hunting is the proximate cause of decline, but habitat loss is continually reducing the maximum population possible if hunting issues were to be controlled, and is increasing the ease with which remaining animals can be hunted.<br/><br/> Several Thai Banteng subpopulations, especially outside the Western Forest Complex, are not increasing or are even declining and continue to face serious threats from habitat loss and habitat degradation, poaching, and loss of genetic diversity (Chaiyarat <em>et al</em>. 2018, Jornburom <em>et al</em>. 2020). Loss of lowland deciduous forest (and hence Banteng habitat) in northern and eastern Cambodia has occurred due to widespread allocation of large-scale economic land concessions for industrial agriculture (particularly rubber and cashew plantations). Approximately 16% of the total forest cover in the country, was allocated to economic land concessions (Magliocca <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Timber logging, land clearing, and illegal hunting intensified within the boundaries of these concessions (Davis <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, EIA 2019). Since 2012, changes in the management of forests and protected areas by the Royal Government of Cambodia led to the revocation and downsizing of a substantial proportion of the economic land concessions and may have mitigated this threat to an extent (Diepart 2016, Ingalls<em> et al</em>. 2018). Nonetheless, the integrity of Banteng habitat in Cambodia continues to be severely threatened by large-scale commercial agro-industry expansion, infrastructural developments (especially roads), and more recently extractive mineral mining. For example, eight mining licenses are currently active inside the two protected areas with the highest concentration of Banteng (Phnom Prich and Srepok wildlife sanctuaries), including within the officially designated strictly protected core zones (Crouthers 2021). The tackling of above threats is severely hampered by significant shortfalls in effective protected area management, particularly in Indochina, which in turn is linked to the long-term uncertainty and loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of adaptive management and possible gaps in political support necessary to uphold high protection standards (Belecky and Gray 2020). In Myanmar, wildlife law enforcement is hampered by the current civil war (N.M. Shwe pers. comm. 2024).<br/><br/> During the 1980s–1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan NPs, the chief threat to the large population of Banteng in Baluran NP was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree <em>Acacia nilotica </em>[now <em>Vachellia nilotica</em>] (Fabaceae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest (Caesariantika <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park’s monsoon forests (Sutomo <em>et al.</em>2019). Since that introduction, repeated cutting of&#160;<em>Vachellia</em> has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that contain little or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the cattle to penetrate. Invasive <em>Lantana camar</em>a (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Banteng habitat in Baluran NP and other NPs on Java (Padmanaba <em>et al.</em> 2017). Habitat loss and degradation and illegal hunting for trade and consumption are currently the key threats to be addressed on Java (Burton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020) and on Kalimantan (Dewi <em>et al.</em>2020). <br/><br/> One Sabah, Banteng decline is primarily attributed to widespread loss of habitat and conversion to agro-intensive tree plantations that cultivate Oil Palm (<em>Elaeis guineensis</em>), Rubber (<em>Hevea brasiliensis</em>), and fast-growing timber species (<em>Acacia/Vachellia spp</em>.) (Gardner<em> et al</em>. 2019b). Disturbance from agriculture and logging intervals in commercially managed forest also causes displacement and stress, potentially influencing breeding of Banteng (P. Gardner pers. obs.). Approximately 11% of the surface area of Sabah is estimated to contain suitable Banteng habitat, and only 12% of suitable habitat is located within formally protected forests (Lim <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021). Banteng populations in Sabah are now confined to remote forest and swamp habitat which are highly fragmented. Habitat connectivity is severely constrained by the presence of oil and nipah palm monoculture stands (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019); the prevention of gene-flow between fragmented populations may compromise the genetic-integrity of future generations. Approximately 60% of suitable Banteng habitat is located within production forests (Lim <em>et al</em>. 2021), but timber plantations are not considered to be a main habitat of Banteng due to the temporary status of the forest and the regular eradication of the vegetation which forces the Banteng into nearby natural forest. Geothermal and hydroelectric development and the extractive mining industry are considered emerging threats to Banteng in Sabah (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019).<br/><br/> On Sabah, illegal hunting of Banteng is rampant and has led to historic extirpations from parts of its’ range (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Melletti and Burton 2014) and ongoing population declines leading to extremely low population densities across the island (Gardner<em> et al</em>. 2019b, Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). Hunters in Sabah are now targeting remnant herds, removing mature breeding individuals important for sustaining herds (P. Gardner pers. obs.). Snare wounds have been identified on Banteng camera trap footage in commercial forest reserves in the north (Sugut Forest Reserve) and central (Segaliud-Lokan Forest Reserve) (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). <br/><br/> Bali cattle have long been interbred with other cattle: Banteng and Bali cattle can interbreed with both common cattle and Mithun <em>Bos frontalis&#160;</em>(Fischer 1980, National Research Council 1983). Hybrids between Banteng and common cattle <em>Bos taurus&#160;</em>of the zebu type are fully fertile; in hybrids between Banteng and <em>Bos taurus</em> of the European type the males are sterile (Jellinek <em>et al</em>. 1980, National Research Council 1983). Domestic and feral livestock are thus a potential threat to the genetic integrity of wild Banteng populations and a number of reports suggest that wild Banteng does interbreed with domestic cattle. For example, Hoogerwerf (1970) referred to several sources from the 1930s and 1940s which mention that many groups of Banteng in Kalimantan (particularly East Kalimantan) were no longer pure-bred having interbred with stray domestic cattle. <br/><br/> The possible erosion of genetic diversity and/or introgression with domestic cattle could pose a potential emerging threat to Cambodian Banteng as population sizes continue to decline and become fragmented sharing resources and forage nearby livestock. However, there is no genetic evidence to suggest introgression is currently occurring. Introgression with domestic cattle is also not believed to be a main current threat to Banteng in Sabah but genetic studies are in their infancy. It is possible that hybridisation has occurred as a result of poor management of domestic cattle at logging camps. One historic report suggested a feral Bali cow or a Banteng/Bali cow hybrid with (white spotted) pelage was hunted within the southwest of Sabah. A separate report suggested domestic cattle were left in abandoned logging camps in Deramakot FR at some point in the past three decades and may have interbred with wild Banteng. Molecular evidence suggests that a feral hybrid Banteng-Bali cattle populations persist within the Felda Kalabakan oil palm plantation in the southeast of Sabah (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). However, in the majority of locations that utilise domestic cattle their security is maintained with fenced enclosures. Nonetheless, there is substantial possibility for disease transmission from domestic livestock as Banteng is found in close proximity to water buffalo and domestic cattle in forest habitat located adjacent to plantations and private land. Disease transmission from domestic cattle to wild Banteng is also a growing concern across Banteng’s extant range on the mainland. For example, the first case of Lumpy Skin Disease Virus was detected in Cambodia in 2021 as a result of disease transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface (Porco <em>et al.&#160;</em>2023). Domestic livestock are a potential source of gastrointestinal parasites for Banteng (Watwiengkam<em> et al.&#160;</em>2024).<em></em><br/><br/> Loss of genetic diversity of Banteng is of primary concern on Sabah, where fragmentation and isolation of populations now prevents movement of individuals and the transmission of genes between populations. The removal of mature individuals by illegal hunting will disrupt breeding behaviour and the social structure of the herds, in addition to the direct loss of genetic diversity. Small and isolated populations across the Southeast Asian range are susceptible to inbreeding, which will undoubtedly lead to a loss of allelic diversity and increase the risk of identical genotypes. Genetic homogeneity in the Banteng will decrease their overall fitness, and their ability to resist diseases and deleterious genetic mutations. Active genetic management of wild Banteng stock in Sabah is most likely the only way to prevent loss of genetic diversity and the imminent threat of extinction.<span class=""msoIns"">","The world population of Banteng is likely to be approximately 3,300 (2,475–4,900) individuals. Four subpopulations of more than 50 animals occur on Java (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Indonesia and Indonesian Species Specialist Group pers. comm. 2024), three in the Western Forest Complex in Thailand (DNP <em>et al.</em> 2024), two in Cambodia in the Eastern and Northern Plains (Groenenberg<em> et al.</em> 2023, Muñoz 2021), and one in Central Sabah (Gardner <em>et al. </em>2021, Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). A once fairly widely distributed species, it is now largely reduced to small isolated subpopulations, most of which are still in decline.<br/><br/> In Cambodia, Banteng probably declined by 90% or more between the late 1960s and the early 1990s (Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2016). Yet, it was reported to remain widespread in low numbers, in northeastern lowland forests, and somewhat more sporadically, in the south and west including the Cardamom Mountain range (Kimchhay <em>et al</em>. 1998, Daltry and Momberg 2000,&#160;Timmins and Ou 2001). Further declines took place from the early 1990s to the mid 2000s, with quite probably more than a 50% decline in this time period for the nation as a whole, and the resultant loss of Banteng populations from significant parts of the still forested landscape (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005). Distance-based line transects conducted between 2010 and 2011 across 3,400 km<sup>2</sup> of the core areas of Srepok WS (SWS , formerly named Mondulkiri Protected Forest) and Phnom Prich WS (PPWS) estimated a Banteng population of 3,201 individuals (95% CI range 1,982–5,170) (Gray <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Line-transect density estimates in Keo Seima WS (KSWS; formerly named Seima Protection Forest) revealed several hundred individuals persisted there around the same time (Griffin and Nuttall 2020, Agger&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2022). In addition, Banteng were known to persist outside of the boundaries of these protected areas. As such, the landscape population was estimated around 4,600 individuals in 2016 and assumed the largest global population of Banteng (Gardner <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). However, accelerating threats (particularly illegal hunting; see Threats) meant that only one decade later this subpopulation has decreased again by over 90% and only a few hundred individuals now remain (Griffin and Nuttall 2020, Groenenberg <em>et al.&#160;</em>2023).<br/><br/> The most recent systematic line-transect surveys estimated a population of 122 Banteng (95%CI: 12–454) in SWS and 195 Banteng (95%CI: 97–832) in PPWS (Groenenberg <em>et al</em>. 2023). In KSWS, no direct observations have been made of Banteng during line transect surveys since 2018 (Griffin and Nuttall 2020, Agger&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2022). Camera trap records and expert opinion suggests that perhaps 15–30 Banteng remain in KSWS (C. Agger pers. comm. March 2023). In Lomphat WS camera trap records and patrol data suggest a small population (&lt;50 individuals) persists (NatureLife Cambodia pers. comm. September 2023). Although some Banteng occur outside protected area boundaries in eastern Cambodia, they mainly consist of lone individuals and a few small herds (Bosco <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Both the line-transect based estimates inside SWS, PPWS, and KSWS, as well as the broader estimates that include camera trap records and expert opinion, indicate that the Banteng population in Eastern Cambodia has decreased with over 90% since 2010, and with <em>c</em>. 99% over the past three generations. Remaining subpopulations in Northern Cambodia are small and fragmented and are unlikely to exceed 50 individuals. One exception may be Phnom Tnout Phnom Pok WS (PTPWS), where active protection has led to a population trend stabilisation over the past five years (B. Davis pers. comm. 2023) and an estimated population of 46–119 Banteng (Muñoz 2021). The combined northern plains population estimate based on confirmed records is <em>c</em>. 400. In the southwest, Prambei Mom community forest supported approximate 40–50 individuals (Marx 2020). As such the national estimate of the Banteng population is estimated not to exceed 1,000 individuals.<br/><br/> Ongoing dramatic population reductions in Viet Nam are largely driven by illegal hunting. Pedrono<em> et al.</em> (2009) estimated the overall population, in five contiguous areas in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam, between 74 and 103 individuals based on data collected between 2005–2007. The largest populations were in Yok Don NP (n=30–44), and Ea So NR (n=23–31). The populations in these two NPs have since declined and the species has been lost from the other three protected areas in the central highlands (A. Tilker and N.M. Ha pers. comm. 2023). In the Yok Don NP, there were no visual observations of Banteng during an extensive line transect surveys in 2018-2019, although signs are still sporadically encountered during patrols and camera trap images captured (WWF-Viet Nam, 2019). If Banteng persist in Ninh Son, their total population is unlikely to exceed 20 individuals (A. Nguyen and A. Tilker pers. comm. 2023).<br/><br/> Numbers in Lao PDR are now likely to be very low, with a nation-wide population size estimated to be below 50 individuals(P. Phiapalath pers. comm. 2023). Steep declines were already reported in the 1990s (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), but the Banteng population in southern Lao PDR was still considered of global significance by the early 2000s (Steinmetz 2004). Local community reports and a short field survey (2018) confirm the continued presence of Banteng in Xe Pian NP, where the resident population is thought to be <em>c</em>. 15 individuals <a name=""_Hlk161911133"">(P. Phiapalath pers. comm. 2023</a>). A recent (2021) camera trap survey in Phou Xiengthong National Protected Area captured one image of a Banteng and the total population is estimated at 7–10 (P. Phiapalath, unpubl. data 2022). The Phou Xiengthong Banteng may be resident or a transboundary population with movements into the Pha Taem NP of Thailand (P. Phiapalath pers. comm. 2023).Although research in the Dong Ampham National Protected Area and Nam Kong Protection forest is lacking, a tiny population (≤15 individuals) may persist here (P. Phiapalath pers. comm. 2023).<br/><br/> There are no robust population estimates of Banteng in Myanmar. However, based on evidence from camera trap surveys and patrol data, the total nation-wide population size is estimated at <em>c</em>. 250 individuals (MONREC 2020).<br/><br/> Thailand is among the few countries where partial recovery of several Banteng subpopulations is starting to be observed, especially in the Western Forest Complex. However, declines continued in other parts of the country and local extirpations have occurred. The total country-wide population was estimated at 2,300–2,500 in 1970 after which it plummeted by over 80% to an estimated 470 individuals by 1995 (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1995). However, these estimates were not based on systematic surveys and did not cover all subpopulations in the country, and thus likely underrepresented the population size at the time (R. Chaiyarat pers. comm. 2024). Banteng range probably declined by approximately 85% in Thailand from 1980 to 2000 (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000), and has continued to decline over the past two decades (DNP <em>et al. </em>2024). Nevertheless the population increases in WEFCOM appear to have been greater than the losses elsewhere, resulting in the nation-wide population curve bending towards an increase with the total population currently estimated at 761–1,086 individuals (DNP<em> et al.</em> 2024). <br/><br/> The country’s most significant population, in Huai Kha Khaeng WS did not increase during years 2006–2008 (DNP and WCS, 2010), but it has increased since then and<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> is currently estimated at 400–500 individuals based on camera trap and sign data (DNP <em>et al. </em>2024). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">On the other hand, it was thought in 2013 that Kaeng Krachan NP may be among the rare populations with over 50 individuals (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2013), but it is currently considered to be one of (at least) eight protected areas where Banteng have been extirpated in the past 13 years (DNP <em>et al.</em> 2024). <br/><br/> The largest subpopulation of Banteng (n= 503–695 individuals) in Thailand occurs in WEFCOM (n=400–500 in Huai Kha Khaeng WS; n=51–100 Huai Thap Salao-Huai Rabum Non Hunting Area; n=100, Khuean Srinagarindra NP; n=31–50, Salakphra WS; n=50–60, Thung Yai Naresuan West WS; n=9–10 in Mae Wong NP) (DNP<em> et al. </em>2024). The south-central Wildlife Sanctuaries of Khao Ang Ruenai and Khao Khio-Khao Chomphu harbour 190–240 Banteng (n=160–200, and n=30–40 respectively) with perhaps a few individuals remaining in Khao Sip Ha Chan NP (DNP <em>et al. </em>2024; R. Chaiyarat Unpubl. data, 2022). The Khao Khio-Khao Chomphu WS subpopulation originated from an accidental release of thirteen Banteng from a local zoo (Chaiyarat <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eastern parks of Thap Lan, Pang Sida, and Ta Phraya are each estimated to hold approximately 11–30 Banteng, with 11–15 individuals in Dong Yai WS (DNP <em>et al. </em>2024). There might be tiny populations of perhaps 3–10 non-breeding individuals scattered over Buntharik-Yot Mon WS, Phu Chong Na Yoi NP, and Yot Dome WS (DNP <em>et al.</em> 2024). However, presence is uncertain in the latter three parks and is currently based on foot print evidence that may have been mistaken with gaur (R. Chaiyarat pers. comm. 2024). In the northwest, tiny breeding populations persist in Salawin WS (n=11–20) and Om Koi WS (8–10) (DNP <em>et al.</em> 2024).<br/><br/> Another present-day stronghold of Banteng is Java, where six large subpopulations (those with more than 50 animals) occurred in 1990, but these declined to only four by 2023 (Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). The largest subpopulation occurs on the east of the Island, primarily inside three protected areas: Baluran NP (an estimated 348 [277–365] individuals by 2023); Alas Purwo NP (n=310±90 [219–405] by 2022); and Meru Betiri NP (n=72 [60–72] by 2021) (Ministry of Environment and Forestry Indonesia, and Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). Another important subpopulation occurs on west Java in the Ujung Kulon NP (n=209 [169–259] by 2022) (Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). <br/><br/> Several smaller subpopulations have likely gone extinct, including the Leuweng Sancang NR (n=10 in 2000, extinct in 2003) (Pudyatmoko, 2004) and the Cikepuh-CiBanteng NR (surveyed in 2015) (Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). Various small populations were recorded in Java in the 1970s and 1980s for which there have not been any confirmed records over the past two decades (Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). Pudyatmoko (2004) estimated: Bonjonglarang-Jayanti Region (a small stable population of unknown size in 1988, with no recent data available), Cimapag Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Cikamurang Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Pangandaran NR (n=25–65 in 2003, with current status unknown), Kediri Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Coast of Blitar (10 individuals in 1988, with current status unknown), Coast of Malang (n=6 in 1988, with current status unknown),<br/><br/> Up until at least the early twentieth century, Banteng was still found throughout what is now Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), albeit disappearing in some areas (in particular, in South Kalimantan) (Gardner&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016).By the early 2000s, Banteng was thought to be widespread but rare in East Kalimantan, on the basis of (mid- and late-1990s) reports from many areas, including Kayan Mentarang NP, and within or close to Hutan Kapur Sangkulirang (an unprotected area that has been proposed for protection since the early 1980s) (Hedges and Meijaard 1999; E. Meijaard unpubl. data). Banteng still occur in East Kalimantan in Kayan Mentarang NP (minimum population counts at grazing areas estimated at least 18 individuals in 2019 and eight in 2020); in Kutai NP (few individuals confirmed with camera traps in 2018); and perhaps along the river Lebau and in Mahakam Ulu (anecdotal evidence); and in Hutan Kapur Sangkulirang NR (no recent confirmed records) (Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). There are concerns over the genetic integrity of Banteng in this area because of the presence of domestic cattle, abandoned in 1979 by villagers, which might have interbred with the wild Banteng (Hedges and Meijaard 1999). A 2018 study found 20–30 Banteng in at least two herds occurred in the Belantikan Hulu concession in Central Kalimantan (Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). Further anecdotal evidence from local reports exists for Pararawen and Sapat Haung NRs in Central Kalimantan and for the Batulicin area in South Kalimantan (Indonesian Species&#160;<span class=""il"">Specialist&#160;<span class=""il"">Group pers. comm. 2024). As such, the total Indonesian population is estimated at <em>c</em>. 1,000 individuals (770–1,200).<br/><br/> The total population on Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) is currently estimated at <em>c</em>. 326 individuals (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). The population is in decline primarily because of hunting for trophies and meat using firearms and snares (Boonratana,1997; Gardner <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019b, 2021). Additional main causes of decline include the continual loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat, and human disturbance causing displacement (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). Quantifying accurate population sizes is problematic and continues to be confounded by a range of issues including the inhospitable habitat, the shy nature of the species, and detection and quantification of the species. Prior to the 1940s, Banteng was reported to be common in riverine areas in the east, and in many areas of shifting cultivation. However, the subsequent widespread use of firearms led to the species' rapid extermination from most areas. In 1982, it was reported to be locally common in logged forest on flat terrain, but under threat as its habitat was converted into permanent agricultural land (Davies and Payne 1982).<br/><br/> The state-wide population estimate in 1982 was 300–550 individuals (Davies and Payne 1982) but this was based on community surveys in accessible locations and did not include all Banteng populations. The biggest population decline occurred during the intensive and extensive timber operation and transformation of lowland forests large-scale plantations (palm oil, cocoa and other crops) late in the twentieth century (Ahmad AH pers. comm. 2008). During this period (years 1970–2000) of intensification, the decline in Banteng was thought to be over 50% on Sabah and Borneo as a whole (B. Giman pers. comm. 2008). In 1990, Banteng still occurred south of Gunung Lumaku (in the upper reaches of the Padas River) but it had been extirpated from all other parts of southwestern Sabah according to local people (Payne 1990)<strong>.</strong><br/><br/> Since this time, new road infrastructure has opened up the interior of Sabah and vast land-use changes continue to remove much of the natural forest habitat. Encroachment and hunting have undoubtedly increased over the past four decades as a result of habitat conversion and extensive networks of logging roads. Some populations are known to have been eradicated in the past four decades (Melletti and Burton 2014, Sabah Wildlife Department 2019).<br/><br/> Four main subpopulations can be distinguished on Sabah, namely in the Southwest, Southeast, Northeast, and Central regions (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). The inhospitable monoculture plantation habitat that separates these subpopulations effectively prevents or severely limits any genetic exchange (Struebig<em> et al</em>. 2011, Gardner<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2021). The largest subpopulation persists in the central forest block, comprising of approximately 122 individuals in the Central-south (n=36 for the Malua Forest Reserve, n=40 for the Maliau Buffer Zone, n= 30 for the Kuamut Forest Reserce, and n=16 for the Sapulut Forest Reserve), and 85 individuals in the Central-north (n=17 for the Tangulap Forest Reserve, n=46 for the Segaliud-Lokan Forest Reserve, and n=22 for the Deramakot Forest Reserve); followed by an estimated 82–152 individuals in the Southeast (n=52 for the Tabin Wildlife Reserve, and n=30–100 for the Kulamba Wildlife Reserve); 35 individuals in the Northeast (n=18 for the Paitan Forest Reserve, n=15 for the Sugut Forest Reserve, and n=2 for the Trusan Sugut Forest Reserve), and 33 individuals in the West (Sipitang Forest Reserve) (Gardner <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). A number of individuals persists in unsurveyed locations such as Kulamba Wildlife Reserve (Sabah Wildlife Department 2019). Gardner <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2019b) found extremely low population densities in Tabin and Malua reserves using a spatially explicit capture-recapture framework ranging from 0.5 (0.21–1.48) individuals per 100km<sup>2</sup> to 0.56 (0.15–2.09) in Malua Forest reserve and from 0.61 (0.32–1.16) to 0.95 (0.54–1.66) in Tabin Forest Reserve. Population models demonstrate substantial probability of extinction of all subpopulations over a forty-year timeframe if current hunting offtake rates persist, with the smaller subpopulations being especially vulnerable (Gardner <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>"
22693464,"<em>Calidris falcinellus </em>is listed as Vulnerable because of estimated declines likely exceeding 30% in the past three generations (13 years). The causes of these declines are not well unknown, but the&#160;drainage of peatlands for forestry in its European breeding grounds has been suggested as a very likely contributor to declines. Across its passage and wintering grounds it is also exposed to numerous other threats, including habitat loss due to land reclamation, hunting and disturbance from fishing activities.","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>There is regular/annual monitoring of this species across its breeding, passage and wintering ranges. This species is not listed on the annexes of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive, but is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU. It is listed on Annex II (strictly protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex I of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 156 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for this species, especially in Finland (which holds most of the EU breeding population) but also in countries where it occurs on passage (EUNIS 2024). It is included on the list of priority EU species that can benefit from a higher EU co-funding rate (up to 75%) under the LIFE Programme, although to date (June 2024) the LIFE project database does not list any projects that have taken practical conservation measures for this species. Outside of the EU it occurs in numerous protected areas, particularly on passage and wintering grounds. China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of&#160;<em>Spartina&#160;</em>cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including&#160;<em>C. falcinellus</em>) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities. North Korea (which is only of marginal importance to this species) became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018, demonstrating their commitment to the conservation of coastal wetlands. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and Southeast Asian countries:&#160; Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by&#160;<em>C</em>.&#160;<em>falcinellus&#160;</em>on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and&#160; leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership. The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands&#160;may also be a threat.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>In Europe (particularly Finland), there is an urgent need to safeguard peatland breeding grounds from forestry.&#160; In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the main action needed for this&#160;is the amelioration of threats on its migration. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of <em>Spartina </em>cordgrass to prevent further loss of feeding habitat (much has already been lost to land reclamation; IUCN 2023). The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. Tools are available, such as AviStep (https://avistep.birdlife.org/) to ensure sustainable building of renewable energy infrastructure. In order to evaluate the success of the conservation actions listed above, robust monitoring is needed, preferably at all stages of its migration cycle. Many of these threats, particularly development of coastal wetlands, apply also to the Arabian Peninsula where there is a need for sensible policy-making and implementation to reduce illegal killing and habitat loss (Brochet <em>et al</em>. 2016, de Fouw <em>et al</em>. 2018).","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is a full migrant, and migrates on a broad front (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) by making short flights between a series of stop-over sites (Verkuil <em>et al.</em> 2006). Adults breeding in Fennoscandia leave the breeding grounds in July (juveniles departing in August), and stop-over in substantial numbers in Sivash, southern Ukraine, on the Middle Eastern coasts, Caspian Sea and Bulgarian seaboard, before arriving in wintering grounds in Africa, Pakistan and south India between August and early-October (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Eastern breeding populations migrate on a broad front across the taiga, or along the eastern edge of the continent between September and October, and return in April-May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).  The Fennoscandian breeding population departs the wintering grounds in the spring between mid-April and early-June (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). A few non-breeding birds also remain at the wintering sites during the summer (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Breeding occurs in early- to late-June in Fennoscandia, and between mid-June and early-July in Russia, pairs nesting in loose colonies of 2-10 nests, usually spaced 80-100 m apart (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species migrates singly or in small groups, although during the spring migration flocks of up to several hundred can occur (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> This species breeds in the wettest parts of bogs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and on open peatland; the Scandinavian and north-west Russian populations breeding in the subarctic montane and lowland zones above 200 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (around 1,000 m in Norway) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and the Siberian population breeding in wet Arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> On migration this species shows a preference for muddy and boggy areas on the shores of ponds and lakes, but it is also found on shallow freshwater, brackish and saline (sometimes hyper-saline) lagoons, temporary swamps, flooded rice-fields, overgrazed wet meadows, inlets of fjords (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species mainly overwinters on large, soft intertidal mudflats, in brackish lagoons, on saltpans (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), sewage farms and saltmarshes (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> This species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of marine nereid worms, small bivalves and snails, crustaceans (e.g. amphipods), adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, flies, grasshoppers, ants) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), as well as the seeds of aquatic plants (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a cup on top of a wet sedge or moss cushion, well raised above the water level (Johnsgard 1981).","Hunting has not been identified as a specific threat to this species, but hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g.,&#160;Gallo-Cajiao <em>et al</em>. 2020, Yong <em>et al</em>. 2022) and it is possible this species is exploited. However, it is unknown whether this is driving population declines.","Numerous threats identified across its range, although the extent to which these are contributing to estimated population declines is largely unknown. In Finland, which likely hosts at least 50% of the global breeding population, drainage of peatlands for forestry is considered the chief threat (Fraixedas<em> et al</em>. 2017, Keller <em>et al</em>. 2020, BirdLife International 2021) and this was also attributed previously to local extinctions in Norway (van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. At Barr Al Hikman, Oman, where up to 8% of the Asian-East African Flyway has been reported to overwinter (Eriksen 1996), planned urban developments, the aquaculture (for shrimp) industry, oil refineries and disturbance from fishing industries and falcon hunting were all identified as threats by de Fouw <em>et al</em>. (2018) and these almost certainly apply to other important staging and wintering sites in the broader region. The extent of hunting in this region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet <em>et al</em>. 2016). Significant numbers of <em>C. falcinellus&#160;</em>migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. Astonishingly, the extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in <em>c</em>. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continued to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien <em>Spartina alterniflora </em>cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the following as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020). In Australia, there are unlikely to be any substantial threats.","Divided into two subspecies, with the nominate breeding in Fennoscandia and north-west Russia, and <em>sibirica </em>breeding in central and eastern Siberia. Almost all of the nominate subspecies breeds in Europe, where there are estimated to be be 30,000-44,000 pairs, most of which (25,000-35,000 pairs) are in Finland (Keller <em>et al</em>. 2020). A much smaller number (&lt;1,200 pairs) breed in European Russia (Keller <em>et al</em>. 2020). When immatures and non-breeding birds are taken into account, these numbers are similar to the wintering population of 61,000-110,000 birds estimated (BirdLife International 2021, Wetlands International 2023). Taxon <em>sibirica </em>is estimated to number 30,000 birds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Mundkur and Langendoen 2022, Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2023); assuming approximately 0.6-0.8 birds are mature, this equates to <em>c</em>.18,000-24,000 breeding pairs. Overall, the global population of this species is estimated a 48,000-68,000 breeding pairs, or 96,000-136,000 mature individuals."
22685513,"<em>Belocercus longicaudus&#160;</em>is expected to have undergone a rapid population reduction in excess of 30% over the past three generations due to the continued loss of suitable habitat and trapping for the bird trade. There is also a projected reduction of more than 30% in its population over the next three generations due to the likely continuation of these threats. Although the species can utilise modified habitats, it is dependent on mature forest for nesting, and therefore is susceptible to habitat degradation alongside overall forest loss.<p></p>","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Listed in CITES Appendix II and occurs in numerous protected areas. <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Research is needed in several areas, including the species population size and trends, the current trend and numbers in the illegal bird trade, and the movements of the species and timing of its utilisation of key habitat sites. Remaining important habitat for feeding and breeding needs to be formally protected. Stricter enforcement is required for the illegal bird trade.<p></p>","<em>B. longicaudus</em> is an extreme lowland species occurring up to 300 m but preferring coastal regions, including mangroves, swamp forest (including peatswamp forest), forest edge, partly cleared land, oil-palm plantations, and coconut groves (van Marle and Voous 1988, Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020, Eaton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Although the species feeds in plantations, rural parks, and gardens, it is dependent on forest for breeding (Puan <em>et al.</em> 2020) and communal nesting (Collar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It&#160;is nomadic, and has poorly understood fluctuations throughout its range (Collar <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The species may occur or arrive suddenly in an area in large flocks, then be subsequently absent for several years (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><p></p>","<p><em>B. longicaudus</em> is threatened by the illegal pet trade, a widespread hobby across the species’ range (Jepson and Ladle 2005). The species has been recorded in trade markets from 1997 to 2001 in North Sumatra (Shepherd 2006), in South Sumatra in 2015 (Iqbal 2015) and Enggano in 2020 (Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020). The species has also been noted in weekend markets in Thailand (Chng and Eaton 2016). The species is also subject to online bird trading (mainly private Facebook groups), which has provided enhanced reach for the trade in Indonesia (Iqbal 2015). An estimated 2,143 individuals were exported annually between 1986 and 1990, mostly from Malaysia (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Up-to-date estimates on the exportation of this species are required.</p>  On Enggano (endemic taxon&#160;<em>P. l. modesta</em>), the species is still regularly shipped for illegal trade despite stricter law enforcement (Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020). Reportedly, trappers with good relationships with officials or ferry companies can easily ship birds off the island (Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020). Birds are also sold to locals and bartered for food or other goods, often being taken directly to Java undetected by authorities (Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020). The birds are most often captured with the use of birdlime, or to directly take chicks from the nests (Iqbal<em> et al.</em> 2020). Locals will often feed the birds addictive foods such as coffee or cake, and deprive them of natural foods (i.e., fruit), which encourages captive birds to always return to their cage (Iqbal<em> et al.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/>The price of <em>B. longicaudus</em> was reported in 2020 as 10-14 USD for an adult and 14-18 USD for a chick (Iqbal <em>et al. </em>2020).","<em>B. longicaudus</em> is a lowland specialist, dependent on intact mangroves and swamp forest (including peatswamp forest) for breeding (Collar <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Puan <em>et al</em>. 2020). The range of&#160;<em>B. longicaudus&#160;</em>has experienced a considerable loss of forest over the past several decades, including 38-45% loss in the three generations (21 years) to 2023 (Global Forest Watch 2024, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein). This is similar to Symes&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018), who predicted habitat loss to have contributed to a 33.8% decline over the next three generations (based on recent remote sensing data). Although the species&#160;occupies plantations, parks, and gardens sites (Jambari<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2012, Amit<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014, Puan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020), forest loss is still likely to be an accurate predictor of population declines as the species breeds colonially in tree cavities found mostly in undisturbed forest (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, Puan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Eaton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><em><br/>B. longicaudus</em>&#160;is additionally threatened from the illegal pet trade, a widespread hobby across the species’ range (Jepson and Ladle 2005). The species has been recorded in illegal trade markets from 1997 to 2001 in North Sumatra (Shepherd 2006), in South Sumatra in 2015 (Iqbal 2015), and Enganno Island in 2020 (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species has even been noted in weekend markets in Thailand (Chng and Eaton 2016). The species is also subject to online bird trading (mainly private Facebook groups), which has provided enhanced reach for the trade in Indonesia (Iqbal 2015). An estimated 2,143 individuals were exported annually between 1986 and 1990, mostly from Malaysia (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Although plantations provide suitable feeding habitat for the&#160;<em>B. longicaudus</em>, they also present additional threat via hunting. The species may be perceived as an agricultural pest and consequentially shot or hunted&#160;(Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020).","There have been no surveys of the populations size of <em>B. longicaudus</em> and the population size is therefore considered unknown. However, the species is described as very common and widespread in South Kalimantan, locally common on Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, as occurring in very large numbers in Brunei, and common in the Andamans and Nicobars (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020, Eaton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It has also been described as common and 'easy to find' on Enggano (Iqbal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The species can sometimes be observed in large communal roosts consisting of more than 1,000 individuals (Eaton <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;Given a large predicted area of occupancy (822,000 km<sup>2</sup>: sRedList [2023]) and the aforementioned descriptions of abundance, the population is expected to be large."
219,"The Cheetah is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A4b based on a population size reduction of 37% (21–51%) over three generations (approximately 15 years) between 2017 and 2032 (A4b) and criterion C1 based on a global population size (tentatively estimated at 6,500 mature individuals) and a  projected averaged continuing decline (C1).<br/><br/>Data from a comprehensive national assessment in Zimbabwe, the only large area that includes protected and unprotected landscapes with reliable population  estimates from two points in time, indicates a decline of 85% over 15 years.<br/><br/>The population projections conducted by Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017) show that if Cheetah outside protected areas are subject to high levels of threat, then the global Cheetah population may decline by more  than 50% over the next 15 years (three Cheetah generations), and thus the Cheetah may be close to qualifying as EN under criterion A3. High levels of threat are expected on the African continent since human  populations in many Cheetah range states are predicted to double over the next few decades, with leading to increased pressures on natural resources (United Nations 2017). Preventing a steep decline in Cheetah populations in the face of an ongoing period of rapid growth in Africa’s human population over the next few decades will be the most serious  challenge for the conservation of this species.<br/><br/>Given the  evidence of ongoing and increasing threats to Cheetah posed by rapid anthropogenic change across the species range, we recommend that the Cheetah is a species under observation and its threat status is closely monitored, with a reassessment after a minimum three-year period or as soon as new information emerges.","The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require  conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial  conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning  across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human  wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a,b, 2012, 2015; Durant <em>et al.</em>  2022). Most Cheetah range (77%) is on unprotected lands where their  habitat is vulnerable and where they are often persecuted in retaliation  for livestock or game depredation (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The  species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is  protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and  some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b,  2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetah to be killed in  defense of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control  regulations (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There is very rarely any  systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way.  Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as  skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional  incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range  states are actively involved with the African Range-Wide Cheetah  Conservation Initiative (CCI) (previously known as the Range Wide  Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs or RWCP), which  has supported them in the participatory development of regional  strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC  strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are  combined in the conservation planning process because of their similar  low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also  increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts  for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three  regional strategies in place for Africa covering all Cheetah range:  Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2015); and  Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012). The Southern  Africa strategy was developed from a review of the initial strategy  developed in 2007 (IUCN SSC 2007b). A similar review of the Eastern  Africa strategy has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is  planned for 2022.<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, the  regional conservation strategies also provide a framework for national  conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation  action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be  tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each  range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most  range states (dates of the initial planning workshop, and subsequent  action plan review, in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007, review  2018), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009, review 2018),  Zimbabwe (2009. Review 2018), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger  (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Malawi (2011);  Namibia (2013); Algeria (2015); Angola (2016); and Burkina Faso (2016).  In addition, Cheetah are included in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National  Conservation Action Plan (2010). These action plans cover nearly all the 30 Cheetah populations in Africa and 96% of known African Cheetah  range. Each national conservation action plan is published by government  wildlife authorities and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah  (and wild dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans  provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations  using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats and the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there  are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they  broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah  conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment  to Cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve  land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and  legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local  and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as  governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is  overseen by three CCI regional coordinators. There are also a number of  different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern  Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and  research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these  projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that  benefit Cheetah, and support for capacity development of national  wildlife authorities. The CCI is the only active cheetah conservation  program in northern, western or central Africa, but there are important  initiatives to safeguard protected areas in this region, including  efforts by African Parks to protect the WAP and Zakouma ecosystems.<br/><br/>The  recent CITES-CMS Africa Carnivore Initiative, adopted at the 12th  Conference of the Parties, provides a range of significant decisions to  improve the conservation status of Cheetah, along with the other three  focal threatened carnivores (see <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.cms.int/en/legalinstrument/african-carnivores-initiative"">https://www.cms.int/en/legalinstrument/african-carnivores-initiative</a>).<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected (Hunter <em>et al.</em>  2007a). Currently, the main protected areas for this species are Kavir  National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Miandasht Wildlife Refuge,  Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Darband e Ravar Wildlife Refuge, Dareh Anjir  Wildlife Refuge, Kamki Bahabad Hunting Prohibited Area and Ariz Hunting  Prohibited Area (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> 2017). Additional small  protected areas predicted to have an important role in connecting  subpopulations should be subjected to more conservation (Ahmadi <em>et al.</em>  2017). Management of livestock in Cheetah habitats, recovery of prey  population and safeguarding roads are other most urgent conservation  measures that should be taken. The UNDP established a programme of work  to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah in 2001, and a  conservation planning workshop took place in 2010, leading to the  development of an action plan for the period of 2010 to 2014. Developing  a new and updated action plan considering the current circumstances is  recommended. UNDP has recently considered stopping their support for  this project, meaning that this project may continue only with national  budget. Considering limited budgets allocated for conservation projects  in Iran, this might be a serious threat to long term conservation of  Cheetah in Asia. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the  country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of  this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought  to be extinct in the country.<p></p><p></p>  <p></p>","In Africa, Cheetah are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions,  ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and  hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, 2012, 2015;  Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2017). They are only absent from tropical and  montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of  4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat  consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than  100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from  plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that  rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> 2018), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli <em>et al.</em>  2009). Cheetah were reported as relatively rare across the large belt  of miombo woodlands in southern Tanzania and northern Mozambique (Myers  1975), and have not been recorded in these habitats in recent years  (IUCN 2007a; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). However, a recent study has indicated that miombo woodlands may be important habitat for Cheetah (Strampelli <em>et al.</em> 2021), raising questions about the value of miombo habitats for Cheetah.<br/><br/>Cheetah  are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching  speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second; Sharp 1997).  However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down  because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual  speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b).  Cheetah make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are  unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of  meters. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to  mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle (<em>Gazella </em>spp.), kob (<em>Kobus kob</em>)  and impala (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>). But their prey can range from  ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large  ungulates such as wildebeest (<em>Connochates taurinus</em>), kudu (<em>Tragelaphus  strepciseros</em>) or eland (<em>Tragelaphus oryx</em>) (Purchase and du Toit 2000,  Broomhall <em>et al.</em> 2003, Mills <em>et al.</em> 2004, Cooper <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em>  2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of  scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Ibex  <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species  (Khalatbari 2021, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012). Earlier studies using  scat suggested that livestock formed an important component of the diet  of Asiatic cheetah (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012), however recent genetic analysis found very little evidence of livestock consumption (Khalatbari 2021).<br/><br/>Cheetah,  unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with  high densities of large carnivore competitors, Cheetah can lose up to  around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and  spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em>  2007c). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a  strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some  evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis  <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use  visual cues to avoid competitors may be a key driver of diurnal  behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such  as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as  being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower  number of competitors or higher human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetah have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2007, 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young,  and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or  three (Caro 1994, Broomhall <em>et al.</em> 2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em>  2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also  be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions  formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard  and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetah appear to mate  with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In  areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female  Cheetah, and males without territories, follow the herds, with average  home ranges of 800 km², while territorial males may hold small territories (average 30 km²) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em>1988,  Caro 1994). A similar pattern whereby territorial males have smaller  territories than non-territorial males has since been observed on  Namibian farmlands, where male territories averaged 379 km²&#160;compared with home ranges of non-territorial males of 1,595 km² (Melzheimer <em>et al.</em>2018). The same study estimated female Cheetah home ranges to average 650 km²&#160;(n=17). Another study on Namibian farmlands found both Cheetah sexes to have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km²);  however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home  range. A study of a small number of individuals in Kruger National Park  found male and female home ranges to be more similar in size, although  more data are required to know whether these data are representative  (Broomhall <em>et al.</em> 2003). It has been hypothesized that the  Cheetah’s unusual social system and ranging patterns originally evolved  as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger  competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a  spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a,b). This is  supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by Cheetah in Botswana  and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In  the wild, Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and  five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have  not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2010b). Cheetah give birth to their first litter at two years after a  three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the  first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to  hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub  mortality can be high. In the Serengeti, 95% of cubs died before  independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most  of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were  able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em>  1992). Elsewhere, cub mortality is reported to be lower, although  information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely  available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth  to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the  Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation  (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key  predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey  Badgers, Jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role (Laurenson 1994,  Mills and Mills 2014).<br/><br/>If Cheetah cubs survive, they will stay  with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will  roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). After  which, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their  first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single  males may also meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition  (Caro 1994). In the Serengeti, mean annual mortality for females and  males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1–2-year-olds; and 0.15 and 0.31  for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult  mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of  juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large  predators (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003c, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). It is  difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti  adult Cheetah have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and  one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b).  Male Cheetah may be killed by other males, probably during territorial  disputes (Caro 1994). More recently, several Cheetah have also been  killed on the main road passing through the Serengeti (see Threats section). <br/><br/>In  comparison with other big cats, Cheetah occur at relatively low  densities (10–30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and  Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant <em>et al.</em>2007). The highest density  recorded for Cheetah, not including small and intensively managed  fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park,  where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km²&#160;(Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but Cheetah can congregate seasonally at high densities (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Melzheimer <em>et al.</em>2020),  which can give a misleading impression of overall density. Caro (1994)  attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich  Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species  such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on  Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors,  Cheetah still occur at low densities of 0.25 per 100 km²&#160;(Marker 2002) and 0.025 per 100 km²&#160;(Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015), respectively. In such environments, Cheetah may be limited by  prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside  other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize  the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant  1998, 2000a,c; Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<p></p>","Illegal trade poses a historical and ongoing threat to Cheetah. Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally into the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah were identified as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia, and global concerns about a resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been recently addressed at CITES (CITES 2013, Mitchell<em> et al. </em>2017). CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). From 2002 to 2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Documentation for illegal trade is more problematic.<br/><br/>Official records show an average of three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetah reported to CITES per year between 2002–2011 (Nowell 2014), and 13 live Cheetahs over three years between 2015-2018 (CITES 2019), however, this is a substantial underestimate of the real trade. Ongoing territorial disputes between Somalia and Somaliland mean that Somalia does not include records of confiscations in Somaliland (where most confiscations occur) in its official records. A comprehensive study utilizing multiple sources found evidence of 1,884 incidents of trade over the decade between 2010-2019 (Tricorache <em>et al.</em> 2021). These incidents were estimated to have involved at least 4,184 cheetahs. This represents nearly 200 incidents per year involving over 400 animals. The majority of individuals traded were traded live (87%), with most of the remaining trade was skins. Trade was detected in 15 cheetah-range states, with the greatest number of traded cheetah recorded in Somalia (42%), Kenya (13%) and Ethiopia (10%). Trade was also detected in 41 non cheetah range states, i.e. transit or destination countries, with the majority in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia (61%), Kuwait (14%) and UAE (14%). These records indicate an illegal trade that is significantly higher than the official reports submitted to CITES, and suggest a recent rise in confiscations.&#160;<p></p>These reports indicate that the Cheetah trade is dominated by a live trade from the Horn of Africa and surrounding regions into the Gulf States. The primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia, and it is likely that many captured cheetah cubs die undetected. Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetah (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetah are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetah in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al.</em> 2014). These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports, however the proliferation of photographs of pet cheetah on social media in these countries, demonstrate that many animals are successfully smuggled into these countries.<p>Because of its proximity to the destination markets in the Gulf States, the Horn of Africa and neighbouring areas is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetah is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Countries in this region have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans, and continue to try and address the issue through CITES (e.g. CITES 2013, 2019). Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond (N. Mitchell, pers. obs.). The Cheetah populations that are the likely source for the live trade are increasingly small and isolated, making them extremely vulnerable to any trade.<br/></p><p></p><p>The currently known cheetah populations in the Horn of Africa, close to the Somali border, are likely to suffer the strongest impacts of the illegal trade in live animals. These include the Ethiopian populations in Afar (estimated 11 individuals); Blen-Afar (20 individuals); Ogaden (32 individuals); and Yangudi Rassa (8 individuals), all of which are highly vulnerable to the impacts of even the smallest trade. The border population with Kenya and South Sudan is slightly higher, with an estimated 191 individuals, but still remains extremely vulnerable to even low levels of trade. The section of the Kenyan and Tanzanian population closest to the Somali border is also at high risk. Populations in south Turkana in Kenya (36 individuals); Kidepo in Uganda through to southern South Sudan and northwestern Kenya&#160; (19 individuals); and the South Sudan populations in Badingilo National Park (85 individuals); Radom National Park (68 individuals); and Southern National Park (147 individuals) are also vulnerable, especially as Cheetahs become increasingly scarce in areas closest to the smuggling routes through Somalia. In total, less than 300 Cheetahs are estimated to remain in the Horn of Africa and its borderlands, with a further 355 Cheetah in South Sudan and northern Kenya likely to become increasingly vulnerable to this trade as populations closest to the destination countries become extirpated.</p><p>Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside Leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.</p><p>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetah (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al</em>  2013), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetah. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetah between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.</p>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008, Anon 2017), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live Cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation. The Department of Environment (DoE) in Iran has recently increased fines for capturing or killing Cheetah to 25.000 $.","As a wide-ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km², Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a,b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much  larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore  species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures  which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC  2007a, b, 2012; Durant 2017).<br/><br/>The majority of Cheetah resident range (77%) and most of the Cheetah population (67%) are found on unprotected land (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Dickman <em>et al.</em>  2014). While Cheetah tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may  kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers either  in retaliation to depredation or to prevent livestock loss (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al.</em>  2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetah are seen as  competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both  subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah  survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that  they can be difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em>  2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other  carnivores such as Hyaena species, Leopards and Lions. There are likely  to be complex underlying issues that can significantly exacerbate  conflict, including, for example, a history of grievance against  government or the establishment of protected areas and external economic  or political processes that have reconfigured human-carnivore relations  (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2022). The multiple threats faced by Cheetah on  unprotected lands, combined with evidence of widespread population  declines, has resulted in the species being termed ‘protection reliant’  (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock  densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion will directly  impact Cheetah population size. The industrial levels of bushmeat  extraction occurring across many areas where Cheetah still occur  (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013, Ripple <em>et al.</em> 2016) has a serious  impact on Cheetah population viability. Prey loss can also have serious  indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent  where wild prey is depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying  conflict with livestock farmers. Cheetah may also become captured in  snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary  target (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). While these bycatch effects on  Cheetah populations are not well quantified, there are multiple  unpublished observations of snared Cheetah (see also Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2009) and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High  speed roads also represent a growing threat to Cheetah subpopulations.  This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major  wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo  National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khar  Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah  mortalities between 2001 and 2016 due to various human-causes, at least  14 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Touran, Bafq and Dareh Anjir  protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality  (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013, CACP unpublished data). Between 2014 and  2019 six adult Cheetah were hit and killed by cars on the dirt main road  through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (S. M. Durant and D.  Minja, pers. obs.). Additional deaths have also been reported on many  other roads, including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such  mortality could have a significant impact on population viability,  particularly when populations are small and/or isolated.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em>  1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists  from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12–15% of  their total time spent for wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe <em>et al.</em>  1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist  behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference  with Cheetah hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are  unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975,  1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother  has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. There  have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah  cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close-up photographs.  In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to  Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by  raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease, notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al.</em> 1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al.</em>  2004), the low density of Cheetah makes it unlikely that infectious  disease presents a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah  are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses.  Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs as  pets to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is  the increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure  development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These  developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah  subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations, which may no  longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in  Iran, especially for the southern subpopulation (Dehghan 2013), but it  is a growing problem in Africa as well.<br/><br/>Climate change will  probably negatively influence Cheetah across their range, including due  to changing patterns of agricultural land conversion. The reduction in  land due to rising sea level, large scale movements of human populations  and increased variability in rainfall will exacerbate negative impacts  of a rapidly rising human population. In Iran, where impacts have been  modelled, it is predicted that climate change will force Cheetah to  shift to more temperate areas where they might face higher levels of  conflict with local people and other large carnivores (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> in 2018).<br/><br/>All  the threats identified above play some role in most Cheetah  subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa,  habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat  (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, 2015). Because Cheetah occur at low densities,  conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management  planning, including maintaining connectivity; as most existing  protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long-term survival of  Cheetah (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). In the desert habitats of northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Eslami <em>et al.</em> 2017, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015). Conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation,  either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across  most Cheetah range (IUCN SSC 2015, Dickman et al 2018).<br/><br/>While the  threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah  decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include  political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity  and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to  support Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetah  occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support  conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to  conserve wildlife. Meanwhile, a lack of environmental awareness, rising  human populations, and social changes are leading to ever-increasing  subdivision of land, land use change and subsequent habitat  fragmentation. These underlying drivers must be addressed if the  immediate threats are to be reduced. Conserving viable subpopulations of  Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>.  Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified  landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that  Cheetah require may be protected, unprotected, or a combination. Cheetah  also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely  to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and  to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving  connecting habitat (Ahmadi <em>et al.</em> 2017). Cheetah survival, ultimately, will depend on political will to combat existing threats and local community support.","In a recent global assessment by Durant <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017), the known  remaining Cheetah populations were estimated to be confined to 9% of  their historical distributional range. These authors estimated the  Cheetah population at around 6,517 mature individuals (7,100 adult and  adolescent animals) distributed over 3,100,000 km².  A recent independent study by Weise <em>et al.</em>  (2017), using an extensive database of georeferenced sightings,  estimated the Cheetah population within the southern African countries  of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, at 3,577 adults and  adolescents (Weise <em>et al.</em> 2017), compared with 4,032 estimated for the same countries by Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017). <br/><br/>The population estimates presented here are derived from Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017) and Weise <em>et al.</em>  (2017), except where stated. These estimates are based on expert  information from in-depth surveys and monitoring wherever possible. This  was particularly the case for the estimates in southern Africa (IUCN  SSC 2007a,b, 2012, 2015; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Where expert-based  information was not available, population estimates were extrapolated  by applying density estimates from comparable areas with known density  to polygons of resident range as mapped during conservation strategy  workshops (see #s 1 to 4) below). Density estimates were conservative,  since sites where abundance is unknown may face higher pressures than  sites where there is better information on abundance (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2017). Density estimates in both studies refer to adults and  independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs. Four density  estimates were used (below) and resulting figures were then adjusted to  represent only the number of mature individuals in the population:<br/><p></p><ol><li>Well-managed, relatively productive, protected areas (PAs). Density was estimated at one individual per 100 km², which falls on the low end of the range for highly productive, well managed PAs (1.3–2.5 per 100 km², Broekhuis and Gopalaswamy 2016, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2014, Durant <em>et al.</em>  2011). We picked this figure as the referenced estimates appear  atypically high, and come from some of the most productive and best  managed protected areas in Africa (the Serengeti Mara ecosystem and  Kruger National Park). It is unlikely that any other protected areas can  achieve densities even at the low end of this range, either because  they are less well managed, or because they are less productive.</li><li>Areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat. Density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km², corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (range 0.25 to 0.83 per 100 km²; Marker 2002);</li><li>The Sahara. Density was estimated at 0.025 individuals per 100 km², using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).</li><li>Two  subpopulations in West and Central Africa which do not align to  categories 1–3. Density was estimated at 0.1 individual per 100 km²,  consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but  lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with the elevated  pressures and direct threats in these regions due to high rates of  habitat encroachment and illegal activities.</li></ol>The population estimates  so derived for Cheetah presented here, including the expert based  estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an  indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are  imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in  a large overall change in population estimates. Thus, the estimates are  extremely tentative and comparisons with previous estimates (which were  also very tentative and based on even weaker data) are unreliable.  Nonetheless, these recent studies provide the best available information  at the global level.<br/><br/>Number of mature individuals in the  population was calculated using estimates from the long-term study of  individually known cheetahs in the Serengeti (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2004). Using a stable age structure model, and assuming 1) half of all  1–2 year olds in a population are independent at 18–24 months; and 2)  that there is a 2:1 ratio of adult females to males, we calculate that  8.2% of a population estimate of independent Cheetahs (adults and  adolescents) constitutes individuals of 18–24 months. We thus use the  equation MI = N - (N*0.082), to calculate the number of mature  individuals older than two years (MI) where N is the estimated number of  adults and adolescents. <br/><br/><strong>Southern Africa<br/></strong>Southern  Africa is a global stronghold for Cheetah, holding a tentative estimate  of  3,526 mature individuals distributed across at least 11  subpopulations (from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017, Weise <em>et al.</em>  2017). A large centre of distribution comprises the majority of the  regional population, <em>ca</em> 3,396 mature individuals, distributed across a  large transboundary landscape covering southern Botswana, Namibia,  southern Angola, northern South Africa and south-western Mozambique. The  remaining subpopulations in the southern Africa region are much  smaller: 60 mature individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 46 in and  around Hwange National Park; 42 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save  Conservancy; 37 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe;  18 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 11 in the Zambezi valley; nine in Banhine  National Park, Mozambique; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe; 24 in the  Moxico region in central Angola; and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe  (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). The latter subpopulation has decreased  substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid-1990s and may  indicate poor long-term viability of isolated Cheetah populations in  small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em>  2006). A large proportion (75%) of the estimated resident range in the  region is outside protected areas, on lands ranched primarily for  livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2015, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas (<em>Crocuta crocuta</em>), have been extirpated from much of this range.<br/><br/>For  the purposes of this assessment, Cheetah populations are considered to  be ‘wild’ when they are not intensively managed, in line with the  guidelines of IUCN SSC (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2019;  see also Redford <em>et al</em>.&#160;2011). Intensive management of Cheetah  (such as frequent translocation of individuals for genetic management)  is necessary in reserves smaller than 1,000 km²&#160;that are  surrounded by impermeable fencing. There are around 330 Cheetah in an  intensively managed free-ranging meta-population distributed across  small fenced reserves in South Africa (Buk <em>et al.</em> 2018) and, more  recently, in Liwonde National Park in Malawi (Dasgupta 2017). These  Cheetah have been excluded from the overall population estimates in line  with the IUCN SSC guidelines. However, when such populations are well  managed, such as the South African Cheetah meta-population, in ways that  allow a wide range of natural behaviours of Cheetah, including hunting,  such populations can make a valuable contribution to ‘wild’ populations  by providing individuals for well-planned restorations.<br/><strong><br/>Eastern Africa</strong><br/>The  Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,102 mature  individuals distributed across 14 subpopulations (from Durant <em>et al.</em>  2017). Only one of these subpopulations is estimated to number more  than 200 mature individuals. In descending order of estimated population  size the 15 subpopulations are: 1,250 mature individuals in the  Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo/Laikipia landscape in Kenya and northern Tanzania;  184 in the Ruaha landscape in central Tanzania; 175 in a transboundary  population through southern Ethiopia, eastern South Sudan and northern  Kenya; 135 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 78 in Badingilo  National Park in South Sudan; 62 in Radom National Park in South Sudan;  55 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 47 in the Maasai steppe  in Tanzania; 33 in South Turkana in Kenya; 29 in the Ogaden landscape in  Ethiopia; 18 in Blen-Afar Landscape in Ethiopia; 17 in the Kidepo  National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan; 10 in the  Afar landscape in Ethiopia; and seven in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in  Ethiopia (recalculated from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). A substantial  proportion (75.4%) of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside  protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional  pastoralist communities (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017), where cheetah face  elevated threats from retaliatory killings; unsustainable rangeland  management leading to a loss of prey; and minimal protection against  other illegal killings (e.g. for trade).<br/><br/><strong>Western, Central and Northern Africa</strong><br/>The  number of Cheetah in western, central and northern Africa is  tentatively estimated at 419 mature individuals distributed across four  populations (from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). These are: 218 mature  individuals in Bahr/Salama landscape in Chad and CAR; 175 in the Adrar  des Ifhogas / Ahaggar / Tassili N’Ajjer landscape in Algeria and Mali;  23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; two in Air et  Ténéré connected to another 1–2 mature individuals in the Termit Massif,  both in Niger. As in the other regions, the majority of the population  (83%) is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by  traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC  2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Many of these areas face  unsustainable killing of wild ungulates, particularly close to  settlements, and unsustainable management of the desert landscapes,  alongside a risk of illegal killing of Cheetahs.<br/><strong><br/>Asia</strong><br/>In  Asia, Cheetah are now confined to Iran, and comprise the subspecies <em>A.  j. venaticus</em>. A recent comprehensive review of available information on  Cheetah in Iran has raised concerns of a dangerous ongoing decline in  Cheetah numbers, (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2017) which confirms that the population size is estimated to be less than 50 mature individuals (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em>  2017). The imprisonment in January 2018 of key individuals who have  been most active in improving the conservation outlook for Asiatic  Cheetah, and the lack of conservation activity since, diminishes hopes  of any recovery of this population (Long 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Global population</strong><br/>The  total known Cheetah population is therefore tentatively estimated at  around 6,517 mature individuals. However, with home ranges documented in  excess of 3,000 km²&#160;(Marker <em>et al.</em> 2008, Weise <em>et al.</em> 2015), movements of translocated animals exceeding 1,000 km (Weise <em>et al.</em>2015) and densities seldom exceeding two per 100 km²,  the combination of wide-ranging behaviour and low densities make the  estimation of Cheetah population size (and hence threat status)  extremely challenging. Moreover, all existing estimates of density and  abundance come from either protected areas (e.g. Kruger National Park,  Moremi Game Reserve, Serengeti National Park), or from areas where there  are active Cheetah conservation organizations working across large  areas (e.g. the Namibian farmlands that are the focus of the Cheetah  Conservation Fund). Few of these estimates provide the time series data  needed to estimate population trends. There are also few reliable  estimates of density or abundance from sites where Cheetah populations  are most threatened and likely to be in steep decline (the exception  being a repeated country-wide survey of the cheetah population in  Zimbabwe; van der Meer 2016). As such, quantitative estimates of  population trends are largely unknown; however, of 18 populations where  trends could be assigned, 14 were assessed to be in decline, three were  stable, and only one could have been increasing (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The  combination of large home range, low density and biased data (from  areas where Cheetah are least threatened), poses a serious challenge to  the assessment of threat for this species. This challenge is further  exacerbated by the finding that the majority of known Cheetah range  (77%) and Cheetah population (67%) are on unprotected lands. Here  Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to multiple threats, including  increased pressures from habitat loss and fragmentation; widespread  human-wildlife conflict; prey loss resulting from overhunting and  bushmeat harvesting and illegal trade (IUCN/SSC 2007a, 2012, 2015). Even  within PAs, because of edge effects and poor law enforcement, Cheetah  remain highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures. In these landscapes  Cheetah live alongside some of the most marginalized and vulnerable  people in the world.<br/><br/>These rural human communities, already under  pressure, are expected to grow rapidly over the next three decades  (United Nations 2017, Gerland <em>et al.</em> 2014), which will place  unprecedented pressures on habitats, wildlife and ecosystems. A recent  assessment has documented extinction of Cheetah from 11 out of 15  protected areas (PAs) in West and Central Africa (73% of site  extinction) (Brugiere <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Zimbabwe, Cheetah  populations have collapsed by 85% and the species has disappeared from  63% of its distributional range over the last 10–15 years (van der Meer  2018). Moreover, Cheetah have been extirpated from much of Mozambique,  Zambia, Tanzania, Zambia, Sudan, Somalia and Angola (IUCN SSC 2007a, 2015), most probably over just the last few decades. It is likely that  Cheetah populations in many countries are facing similar steep declines  due to rapid land use change and rising intolerance of Cheetah outside  PAs (van der Meer 2018), as well as a massive bushmeat trade, which has  removed prey from large tracts of Cheetah range (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). This wider context is key to the interpretation of a recent in-depth examination of Cheetah status by Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017).   <br/><br/>The  global population of Cheetah is highly fragmented. Of the 33  populations that still survive, only two have an estimated size of more  than 1,000 mature individuals (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). The analysis by Weise <em>et al.</em>  (2017) suggests that the largest population of Cheetah in southern  Africa is likely to be more fragmented than that depicted in Durant <em>et al.</em>  (2017). Furthermore, two thirds of populations comprise fewer than 100  mature individuals and, even more worryingly, six populations do not  even reach double digits. It is likely that, without urgent conservation  intervention, many of the smaller populations will go extinct over the  next 1–2 decades.<br/><br/><strong>Previous IUCN threat assessments and problems with trend estimation:</strong><br/>The  lack of reliable data on population trends for Cheetah, particularly in  past IUCN Red List threat assessments, has led to the use of  distributional range as an index of population size. However, because  Cheetahs are wide-ranging, distributional range estimates are likely to  be weakly correlated with population abundance. This is because an area  may appear to be widely occupied by Cheetah through reliable  observations, yet the density could be extremely low (Belbachir <em>et al.</em>2015). For example, if well protected and productive, an area of 10,000 km²&#160;could support up to 250 individual Cheetah, whereas, if the area is  unproductive and/or subject to high levels of anthropogenic pressures,  it is likely to hold only 4–20 individuals (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weise <em>et al.</em>  2018). This problem is further compounded by the fact that current  distributional range is delimited using observational records collected  over the previous decade; thus older data may mask recent rapid  declines.<br/><br/>The problems inherent in the data available on  population size and trends for Cheetah, particularly with respect to  historic information, means that comparisons of current estimates with  previous estimates to infer population trends are unreliable. In the  2015 IUCN Red List assessment, estimates of past distributional range  reduction were 29% over the past 15 years, assuming a constant rate of  contraction over the last 100 years. This range collapse, when projected  forwards, predicted a further reduction of 28% over the next 15 years  (stated as more than 10% in the assessment text). However, it is likely  that the observed range collapse has accelerated through time, with the  steepest collapse occurring most recently. Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017)  simulated the global Cheetah population by setting the initial  population equal to a rounded estimated population of 7,000 individuals,  of which 33% occurs in PAs. Populations were simulated over time under a  range of scenarios with growth rates less than replacement outside PAs;  with varying rates of movement inside and outside PAs; and with  populations stable within PAs (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauvenet <em>et al.</em>  2011). There is a projected decline of a past and inferred decline  tentatively estimated at 21–51% between 2008 to 2023 (three  generations); a past and inferred decline of 14-38% between 2008 to 2018  (two generations) and a past decline of 8–21% between 2008 to 2013 (one  generation; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Moreover, simulations showed  that declines of more than 50% were likely over the next three Cheetah  generations or 15 years (generation data from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004)  if the growth rate was 10% less than replacement outside PAs. Such a  decline in global population size raises concerns that the Cheetah  population could meet the IUCN Red List Category of Endangered under  Criterion A3b [a population size reduction of &gt;=50% projected or  suspected to be met within the next three generations based on an index  of abundance]. Sensitivity analysis showed that growth rates within PAs  needed to be 8% or higher to counteract such a decline. Whilst higher  growth rates are theoretically possible; in practice, Cheetah within PAs  suffer from high levels of predation from other, larger, predators such  as lions and spotted hyenas (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em>  2004). Such predation, combined with limitations imposed by prey  availability, prevents high growth rates. In the Serengeti National Park  female Cheetahs are only just able to replace themselves (Laurenson  1995, Chauvenet <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>The results from simulated  projections of the global Cheetah population are consistent with  regional evidence of recent steep population decline. In Zimbabwe,  Cheetah distributional range contracted by 11% per year between 2007 and  2015, while the population has collapsed by 85% over a similar period,  from an estimated minimum of 1,520 cheetahs in 1999 to only 150–170  Cheetahs in 2015 (IUCN/SSC 2007b, 2015, van der Meer 2018). Almost all  this loss has occurred outside of protected areas (van der Meer 2018).<br/><br/>While  Zimbabwe has been subject to recent rapid land use change from  wildlife-based land use to agricultural use, which is likely responsible  for the steep decline in Cheetah, rapid declines leading to extirpation  across large areas have also been observed in western Africa (Brugiere <em>et al.</em>  2015). Elsewhere in Africa, predicted rapid growth in human populations  (United Nations 2017) and associated pressures on natural resources  means that similar patterns of Cheetah population collapse are likely to  be repeated across many countries over the coming decades. Durant <em>et al.</em>  (2017) used their analysis to develop a decision tree to help  categorise ‘protection reliant’ species such as Cheetah, that are  dependent on active conservation for their survival, but which have  substantial distributional range outside PAs where they are vulnerable  to rapid anthropogenic change."
70205537,"Greater Hog Badger is listed as Vulnerable because it is undergoing a hunting-driven population decline. Although rates in the eastern parts&#160;of its range, notably Viet Nam and Lao PDR, on average probably exceed 50% per 15 years (three generations), in large parts of the west and centre they may not even reach rates appropriate for Near Threatened listing (20-25%). Thus, Vulnerable is a global average. There is no reason to expect the decline rates to slow down; in particular, in Myanmar and Cambodia they may be increasing, fuelled by rising affluence and market connectivity. The situation in Cambodia is particularly likely to worsen, with increasing snaring in the eastern provinces that border Viet Nam, a known demand for traditional medicine that might be widespread in rural areas, and ongoing massive clearance of natural habitat for&#160;agro-industrial concessions.&#160;This species should be periodically reassessed for the Red List in light of ongoing threats and uncertainty about range-wide levels of exploitation and the effects these are having on wild populations. The change from the recent Near Threatened listing of <em>Arctonyx collaris&#160;</em>(<em>sensu lato</em>) reflects the taxonomic revision, excluding the populations of Sumatra (where ongoing declines are likely to be negligible) and most of China (where declines are also likely to be lower than average for Greater Hog Badger).","Throughout its range, Greater Hog Badger is found in a number of protected areas, perhaps particularly in Myanmar, India and Thailand (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2008, Choudhury 2013, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). This species is protected by law in Thailand (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014), in Bangladesh (as a Schedule 1 species) under the Wildlife Act 2012 (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), and in India, under the highest level of protection (Choudhury 2013). This species is not protected in Viet Nam or Cambodia and is the largest-bodied unprotected mammal, except for Eurasian Wild Hog <em>Sus scrofa</em>, in Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). The China Red List has listed hog badgers (as a monospecific genus, under this species's name) as Vulnerable under C1 and A2c.","Greater Hog Badger is active throughout the day and night (despite past statements that the genus is nocturnal), ground-dwelling, and not very wary of people (e.g., Pocock 1941, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Helgen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Holden and Neang 2009, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Gray <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014b).<br/><br/>Greater Hog Badger occurs down to the extreme lowlands (e.g. Bottom-Soaker National Park, Cambodia, and Kaziranga NP, Assam, India; Royan 2010,&#160;Choudhury 2013) up into the montane zone. The genus has been found up to 3,500 m, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no record of this species above the relatively modest altitude of 1,500 m. Similarly, and based largely on different sets of records, the highest-altitude records traced for various countries are, Vietnam, 950 m (Roberton 2007); Cambodia, 1,200 m (Holden and Neang 2009); Myanmar, 1,500 m (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008); and Thailand, 1,016 m (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) . However, as cautioned by&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008), relevant survey effort above 1,500 m has been relatively limited in Myanmar and this is generally true throughout this species's range. Thus, the typical upper altitudinal limit may be found to be somewhat, even considerably, higher, as supported by records in Lao PDR up to nearly 2,300 m (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Choudhury (2013) recorded the genus up to 2,000 m in India, but suggested that the higher-altitude records would be of <em>A. albogularis</em>.<br/><br/>This species occurs across a wide variety of habitats, from heavy forest (both deciduous and evergreen) to the non-forested 'countryside' in at least North-east India; this includes grassland-dominated floodplains such as Kaziranga NP in Assam (Choudhury 2013), where it is one of the most frequently camera-trapped small carnivores (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). There are also records in Bangladesh (assumed to be this species) from tea-gardens and other non-forest habitats (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). In South-east Asia most records come from forests. The extent of actual and potential occupation of non-forest habitats is unknown: concerted survey in them is rare and off-take of mammals of this size is heavy in much of this species's range. Thus, it is possible&#160;that they would occur widely in non-forest parts of&#160;South-east Asia but are currently excluded by hunting levels.<br/><br/>The diet is poorly known, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) speculated that it might be partly to strongly vermivorous. This was based on morphological attributes more than on direct dietary information. A strong dependence on worms would neatly explain the pattern of current habitat use in Lao PDR (see 'population') - widespread and still locally common in montane areas but nearly or effectively extirpated from the plains. The country's plains have a harsh dry season, when the ground even within semi-evergreen forest (true evergreen forest is highly localised in the country's lowlands) bakes hard. Finding large numbers of worms under such conditions is presumably difficult and highly demanding of energy. By contrast, in the mountains, forest soil remains damper through the dry season, as a result of cooler temperatures, the sometimes frequent mists and cloud, and the fuller shading of true evergreen forest. Thus, in regions with a harsh dry season, it is reasonable to suppose higher population densities in hills and mountains than in plains and low hills, and a higher resilience to hunting. Such seasonality occurs almost across the species's range excepting most of Vietnam, the Thai-Malay peninsula and locally around massifs large enough to generate their own precipitation. Nonetheless, the species does occur in plains regions of Cambodia and Thailand with dry seasons as or more harsh than in Lao PDR; these areas have&#160;somewhat to much lower hunting pressure.","To varying extents across its range, Greater Hog Badger is eaten, sometimes with a medicinal purpose, e.g. in the 'northern plains' (Ai Suzuki pers. comm. 2014) and the ‘eastern plains’ of Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a). In Lao PDR, the palatability of this hog badger varies between ethnic groups, with some groups disliking the taste, whereas groups in parts of the Nam Theun basin (and presumably elsewhere) esteem the species as food (J.P. Baker pers. comm. to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, J. Chamberlain per. comm. to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). The genus, presumably including this species, is also eaten by some groups in India (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006), and is hunted as well as farmed for food in China (M.W.N. Lao pers. comm. 2006). Across most of its range, most of the catch is probably not targeted, but is by non-selective methods for wildlife meat, or opportunistically during activities other than hunting.","The heterogeneous pattern of Greater Hog Badger detections and the variation in encounter rates, with the lowest rates in the very heavily hunted countries of Viet Nam and Lao PDR, strongly suggest that the species is in hunting-driven decline. Based on Lao PDR, extirpation, or decline to densities making detections extremely unlikely, seems to have proceeded faster in areas with marked dry seasons than in mountain evergreen forests with a more benign dry season, presumably because starting populations were higher in the latter habitats than in the former (see 'Habitats and ecology'). In Viet Nam, trade-driven hunting rose to industrial levels&#160;a decade or so earlier than in Lao PDR. The low number of camera-trap survey areas in Viet Nam with records of the species indicate that even in the presumed optimal habitats of evergreen forest with only a mild dry season, steep declines and, presumably, extirpation can occur. To date, hunting is at much lower levels in the rest of this species's range. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, much hunting involves metal cable snares set in long lines linked by drift fences, an approach very effective in catching ground-dwelling animals (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014); these snares are, mostly, big enough to secure Greater Hog Badger, because large ungulates are amongst the main targets. The geographical use of such snaring has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years and evidently continues to do so. In much of the species's range, most people entering forest and other natural habitat for whatever reason are accompanied by dogs, many have firearms, and most secure opportunistically any animal of hog badger size-class that they come across. Being partly diurnal, ground-dwelling and not prone to shyness, hog badgers must be particularly at risk to such opportunistic off-take.<br/><br/>The threat which habitat change poses directly to this species is not clear. Indirectly, anything that opens up access to areas previously difficult to enter, in particular which allows vehicular removal of wildlife for sale, exacerbates the hunting threat. Almost all forms of habitat change by people co-occur with increased human access and presence, making the indirect threat from habitat change severe. Based on localities of specific records, it is unlikely that degraded and fragmented natural habitat are inherently unsuitable. These are not widely occupied probably because their higher densities of people, with concomitantly increased likelihood for badgers of lethal incidental encounters with people, prevent this. Outright conversion to entirely artificial habitat (agriculture, settlement and infrastructure) seems more likely to render an area unsuitable for Greater Hog Badger, but even this remains to be proven. Overall, the existence of large tracts of forest in the eastern parts of the species's range with at best low densities of this species indicate that there the chief threat is hunting. While perhaps this is not yet so in parts of the western range, it is increasingly likely to become so there, too.<br/><br/>In Kaziranga National Park, India, numbers die in the periodic inundation of this flood-plain (Choudhury 2013). While formerly such animals might have been able to move safely to higher ground, the increasing fragmentation of natural habitat probably leads to higher mortalities nowadays. Nonetheless, in total these are likely to be insignificant to overall decline rates of the species, and are only a potential threat at the most local of levels.<br/><br/>Hog badger hairs are used in European shaving brush manufacture (Domingo-Roura <em>et al</em>. 2006) but whether this species and wild populations are involved is unclear; the large farmed stock in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) seems a more likely origin.","Greater Hog Badger populations have not been studied in sufficient detail for densities or trends to be known in any part of the range. Camera-trap encounter rates vary widely across its range: in some it is among the most commonly and widely photographed small carnivores, such as in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Nakai–Nam Theun National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), in others it is only rarely found if at all (e.g., modern Viet Nam: Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3).<br/><br/>At least two factors might produce this heterogeneous recording pattern: (i) natural variation in densities and (ii) human-induced declines proceeding at different rates across the range.&#160;Both are probably important. Past information is rarely precise enough to assess even the coarse population trend directly. However, judging by patterns in better documented hunting-sensitive groups of ground-dwelling mammals (e.g., wild cattle <em>Bo</em><em>s</em>, Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>), it would be reasonable to expect human pressure to have depressed densities in Lao PDR and Viet Nam more than in Thailand and Cambodia. And this indeed seems to have happened. Recent camera-trapping has recorded the species in only very few areas in Viet Nam (Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3, Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014); Roberton (2007) had already drawn attention to the surprising paucity of records in the country in the 1990s and early 2000s. In Lao PDR, by contrast, all published large-scale camera-trap surveys have found the species (Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA,&#160;Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009; Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Xe Sap NPA, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b), indicating a healthier status than in Vietnam (as is typical for hunting-sensitive species). The three camera-trap survey areas are likely to hold amongst the least-depleted large mammal faunas in Lao PDR. All are in rugged mountainous areas and indeed all post-1990 Lao records of Hog Badger come from hill and montane areas; there has been none from the plains. This pattern, making due allowance for the distribution of survey effort, was already apparent in the pre-camera-trapping era by 1999, based on direct sightings and records of dead animals or their parts (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). By contrast, this species is commonly recorded at low altitudes, including in plains landscapes, of Thailand and Cambodia (Royan 2010, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a,&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014) and it is common in similar lowland terrain in Kaziranga NP, Assam (Choudhury 2013). This suggests strongly that the absence of recent Lao records from such terrain (where hunting is more efficient than in rugged terrain, meaning that hunting-sensitive species across a range of vertebrate taxa tend to have declined faster there) reflects steep declines (and plausibly widespread extirpation) there.<br/><br/>The occurrence in Myanmar is also patchy without obvious natural explanation (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008); thus far, the pattern of records has not been&#160;compared closely with those of species known to be sensitive to hunting.&#160;In&#160;Cambodia, while it has been recorded relatively commonly in some areas such as parts of the north-east (Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a), in the 'northern plains', west of the Mekong, it was not recorded in 6,000 camera-trap nights of survey in the 2012-2013 and 2013–2014 dry seasons, and the most recent record there seems to have been in 2001 (D. H. A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Thus area abuts Lao PDR and this apparent range retreat corroborates the suggestion that it has been hunted out from such habitat in Lao PDR.&#160;In Thailand, it seems to remain generally common with no large landscapes of (semi-) natural habitat lacking records (when patterns in survey effort are allowed for) (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In North-east India the genus, although widespread, is generally not common (Choudhury 2013). The population status in its Chinese range (part of Yunnan province) seems poorly known, even at the level of genus."
22037,"Based on observed declines in populations such as those observed from extensive habitat loss&#160;between 1989 and 2000 which resulted in fragmentation into 19 pockets where the Golden Langur survived for sometime in high densities before being extirpated, the species is listed as Endangered due to population declines suspected over its entire range at more than 50% over the last three generations (36 years).&#160;It is suspected that the rate of decline in India is well above 60%, definitely more than in Bhutan; but given the overall disturbance in both the countries due to increasing number of development projects, damming, conversion of forests for settlements, cultivation and plantations, the destruction of habitat is on the increase and is expected to continue into the future for another two decades at least at the same rate.","This species is a Schedule I species in the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). It is also listed on CITES Appendix I (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). The Chakrashila Wildlife Sanctuary is the only protected habitat for this species in India (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, Srivastava <em>et al</em>. (2001) reports that the species is also found in Ripu, Chirrang, and Manas Forest Reserves. Yet these reserves are unstable, and the complete protection of Manas National Park is needed (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). By upgrading the protection and status of this species, it is believed that isolated populations can be linked through corridors that will prevent genetic fragmentation (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). A long-term study is needed to assess the actual impact of habitat alteration on the species over long periods of time (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Medhi <em>et al.</em> (2004) suggest the following actions to protect the population of this species in Nayakgaon: insulation or diversion of electric lines, motivate villagers to restrain their dogs, planting of trees to develop a corridor between the Nayakgaon population and the Chakrashila population, a long term study of behaviour and ecology, and regular monitoring of the population. <br/><br/>Chetry and Chetry (2009) suggested habitat conservation, forested corridors linking the fragments, habitat restoration of the degraded forest, wild to wild translocation of isolated populations, community participation in forest management and trans-boundary&#160;conservation programme for the conservation of the species. In Bhutan, this species is found in&#160;Jigme Singye Wangchuk&#160;&#160;Black Mountains National Park (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001), Pipsu Wildlife Sanctuary, Royal Manas National Park and Trumshingla National Park (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003). <br/><br/>Molur <em>et al.</em> (2003) list the following research actions needed for the conservation of this species: taxonomy, survey studies, limiting factor research, and habitat fragmentation. The following management actions are needed: habitat management, wild population management, monitoring, public education, and Population and Habitat Viability Assessment.<br/><br/>The Central Zoo Authority initiated a conservation breeding programme for the species in Assam State Zoo at Guwahati in 2008.","<p>This species is found in moist evergreen, dipterocarp forests, riverine, and moist deciduous forests, temperate and subalpine forests and occasionally in degraded habitats with secondary growth (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001) and broad leaf forest, sal forest, sub-tropical forest (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species experiences a considerable range in elevation of near sea level in the south to above 2,607 m in the north at Chendebji (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wangchuk <em>et al</em>. 2003). One isolated population is found in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, Nayakgaon, in the Kokrajhar district of Assam (Medhi&#160;et al. 2004). Study of this population has shown that the animals can withstand the effects of habitat change to some extent and survive in altered habitats (Medhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The diet consists of young and mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits, and seeds, with most feeding spent on young leaves (Gupta 1998, 2002). Subba (1989) and Subba and Santiapillai (1989), however, found that this species prefers fruits and buds to leaves. In forest fragments they may depend on cultivated crops such as tapioca, betel, and guava. It is diurnal and arboreal (Khajuria 1977).<br/><br/>Long-term field studies show that the species spends 12.8–33% in feeding, 40–63.14%in resting, 6.29–19% in locomotion, 5–11.54% in monitoring, 2–3.7% time in playing and 0.35–6% time grooming and other social activities (Mukherjee 1996, Chetry 2002, Biswas 2004, Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). The home range of the species varies from 2 to 58 ha depending on the habitat quality (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Being a folivore the principal share of its diet is leaves, yet they consume other food item like fruits, seeds, flowers and insects on a regular basis. The species spends 60% of the time on feeding leaves, 24.6% time on fruits, 5.99% time on petiole, 2.5% on flower and flower buds, and 2.56% on stem cortex and shoot. They were also reported eating gum, soil, algae and burned wild potatoes and arium, snail (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Chirang Reserve Forest, the buffer between Manas and Ripu-Chirang Elephant Reserve, the langurs were seen to feed on <em>Cryptocoryne retrospiralis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>",The species is not in use or trade.,"<p>Due to habitat destruction, the populations of this species are restricted to fragmented forest pockets, especially in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava <em>et al</em>., 2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and logging, woodcutting and domestic fuel wood collection have severely affected the habitats of the species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). The political unrest, the settlement of&#160; refugee in the habitat, developmental activities , shifting cultivation, commercial logging, rubber plantation, contributed the habitat destruction of the species (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160; Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.</p> <p>Recorded forest cover lost during 1997-2001 has been reported in the following as Chirang Reserve Forest (593 km<sup>2</sup>) reduced to 393 km<sup>2</sup>, and&#160;Bengaltal Reserve Forest reduced to 5 km<sup>2</sup> during this period and similar trend was reported throughout the distribution range in India except in protected areas. The habitat is still under tremendous anthropogenic pressure in the form encroachments, expansion of agricultural activities&#160;and other development activities are existing&#160;and which is expected to&#160;continue in future too.&#160;There was massive habitat loss between 1989 and 2000, which resulted in severe fragmentation into 19 pockets where the Golden Langur survived until sometime and eventually disappeared (Choudhury 2002).</p> <p>Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J. Das pers. comm.).&#160;Poisoning due to organochlorine insecticide is another threat to the population as witnessed in a rubber plantation in Kokrajhar, Assam (Nath and Chakraborthy 2011).</p><p>It is suspected that the rate of decline in India is well above 60%, definitely more than in Bhutan; but given the overall disturbance in both the countries due to increasing number of development projects, damming, conversion of forests for settlements, cultivation and plantations, the destruction of habitat is on the increase and is expected to continue into the future for another two decades at least at the same rate.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>A total of&#160;5,141 individuals in 566 troops were sighted in&#160;India in mid-to-late 2000s (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ghosh <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 6,637 individual reported from Bhutan in early 2000s (Wangchuk 2003). Demographic trends indicate a decline in the population of this species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001). Groups were bigger and densities higher in areas of more degraded habitat (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001), however, owing to disturbance and felling, the langurs remained in higher densities&#160;for quite some time but currently they have totally disappeared from degraded habitats. The langurs near the National Highway such as Bismuri and other places have vanished. The high density was due to crowding from sudden habitat loss and degradation. The langurs survived for quite some time in such habitat as the local people generally do not kill for meat unlike many other areas of northeastern India (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>The population has declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years, and is expected to decline further in the near future due to various threats outlined by field biologists in both India and Bhutan (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Population densities in Manas National Park, and Ripu and Chirrang reserve forests are 8 ind/km², 46 ind/km², and 64 ind/km², respectively. The Golden Langur Conservation Project saw a rise in the langurs population across the range in India, from 1,500 in 1997 to 5,600 in 2007–2012, and in Bhutan, estimated to be 6,600 in number. Estimated range size at present is 1,506 km². The density has also significantly increased from one individual/km² to 3.71 individuals/km² in 2009. Distribution&#160;area&#160;in the protected area and outside protected area in India is 1,993 km² and in the protected areas of Bhutan is 2,992 km² (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2010). Overall there is no increase (except in some pockets) but populations have declined sharply in areas such as Chirang RF. In 1997 count, the coverage was poorer than in 2007-12, hence larger population in 2007–2012&#160;(Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019). <br/><br/>Populations of Golden Langurs in smaller fragments have lower nucleotide diversity than those in larger fragments.

Some major causes are jhum cultivation, monoculture plantations, timber and firewood harvests, and other development, resulting in the loss of fruiting and lodging trees. Also, these animals are subject to trade for their meat and other body parts, and as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>Encroachment, slash and burn shifting cultivation and fragmentation are the other threats. Hunting for meat is of serious concern in some parts of Assam, central and eastern Arunachal Pradesh, hill districts of Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram. They are also hunted their pelts which is used to make&#160;dao&#160;sheaths. Unsustainable bamboo harvest in Jagiroad, Panchgram and Jogighopa in Assam and Tuli in Nagaland. Petroleum, open-cast coal mining and limestone mining, poor law enforcements, fragmented population susceptible to local extinction. Mijikajan tea estate (Sonitpur district), Hatipoti village (Tinsukia district), Diroi and Sola reserved forests (both in Sivasagar district) are such isolated fragments where the capped langur could go extinct soon. Border skirmishes with Nagaland have already extirpated the langur from Nambhur, Dhipu, and Rengma reserve forests in Golaghat (Choudhury 2014). <br/><br/>Large scale habitat destruction and&#160;&#160;encroachment for human settlement and agricultural activities have been recorded and going on in the north bank of Brahmaputra (Das and Chetry pers. comm.). The population&#160;estimates in Assam seems to have been halved from 39,000 in 1989 (Choudhury 1989) to 18,600 in the 2008-2014 estimate due to habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation due to developmental activities, plantations and settlements (Choudhury 2014).&#160;It can not adapt like Rhesus and hence, habitat loss has impacted it severely in areas such as Sonitpur, upper Assam and Barak valley districts.","This species is the most common langur in north-eastern India (Choudhury 2001). Although sympatric with Hoolock Gibbons in South Asia, it is not as heavily impacted by the effects of habitat loss and is more adaptive, breeds more rapidly, and can move across fragments easily (A. Kumar and J. Das pers. comm.). However, the species has probably declined by more than 30% in the last 20 years, making it very vulnerable in its extremely fragmented locations (J. Das, A. Kumar and M. Singh pers. comm.; Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003) and it is predicted to decline at the same rate in the next 20 years (J. Das, A. Kumar and M.

The species has a narrow range of bioclimatic and habitat suitability (125 m to 600 m in elevation).

15951,"The Lion is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A2abcd based on an estimated 36% decline in the species' range over three generations (approximately 21 years) and therefore a similar population reduction is suspected.<br/><br/>Despite the Lion being well-studied, uncertainty remains a challenge in assessing this species (refer to the section on this topic under Population below for more detail). In recent years, considerable conservation effort has led to stable Lion populations in some areas and even species recovery in others (e.g., reintroductions into the Zambezi Delta in Mozambique, Akagera in Rwanda). However, over the last 21 years, declines in certain populations have also occurred (e.g., Limpopo National Park, Etosha National Park, and Niassa Game Reserve) with some areas experiencing local extinctions (e.g., Quirimbus National Park in Mozambique, Yankari Game Reserve in Nigeria (P. Funston pers. comm. 2023) and Toro-Semuliki Wildlife Reserve in Uganda). The present assessment is guided by the best available data and methods. Uncertainty is a common problem in the assessment of long-lived species where trends are assessed over a time span that either includes historical periods where some survey techniques were not yet available, or future periods that are inherently unpredictable.<br/><br/>Extant Lion range in 2023 is estimated to be 1,571,296 km<sup>2</sup>, only 6% of its historical range. This is an estimated 36% range decline since 2002 (three Lion generations), where range was estimated to be 2,460,986 km<sup>2</sup>. This decline, which is likely to continue, reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.<br/><br/>A population of between 22,000 and 25,000 adult and subadult lions in Africa (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2018; African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023) and ~670 adult and subadult lions in India (Gujarat Forest Department 2020) was estimated for this assessment. This is an estimated decline from ~33,000 lions in 2006 (IUCN 2006 a, b), an estimated 30% decline in 17 years (i.e., less than three generations). The former figure shares a common background with Bauer <em>et al. </em>(2018), and the latter informed estimate in 2013 (Riggio <em>et al. </em>2013) show that these numbers are similar but with different reference years. These numbers all have extensive caveats, enormous uncertainty, and were partly based on differing methodologies; they cannot be used for a direct calculation of population trends, but they are consistent with the estimated range decline of 36%. Riggio <em>et al.</em> (2013) showed that declines in savanna habitat translate into declines in Lion numbers. Lindsey <em>et al.</em> (2017) showed that Lion densities vary substantially across their range, and that lions occur at levels below 50% of carrying capacity in two thirds of the sites they analysed. However, these sites were spread all over the African continent, and the range decline is also across the continent, so we have no reason to reject Lion range decline as a direct proxy for Lion population decline. This supporting evidence suggests that range declines equate proportionately to Lion population declines, and that range is an appropriate measure for our assessment. Therefore, this suspected decline of 36% in population is justified.<br/><br/>The previous Red List Assessment (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015) used a representative subset of estimates to infer a global population decline of 43%, albeit with regional variation. That same dataset was used in the same year with the same result, but with a much-improved methodology that involved Bayesian modelling to predict the probability of population decline (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015). This assessment used the same improved methodology to demonstrate the plausibility of our assessment (see the Population section for more details). In summary, using Bayesian modelling, we estimated Lion populations in Africa to have a 41% probability of declining by one third (33%) within three Lion generations (including past, present, and future), while this risk is estimated at 2% in India (Table S1 in the Supplementary Information). This supports a ≥30% reduction threshold for a Vulnerable listing for Lion. The probability of a 33% decline within three generations is estimated to be 74% in West Africa, 36% in East Africa, 33% in Central Africa, and 20% in Southern Africa (Table S1 in the Supplementary Information). However, while it demonstrates strong support for a Vulnerable listing, it cannot be used as a formal method to which we assess the species as this method is not fully consistent with the IUCN Red List Guidelines. <br/><br/>There are high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, with 12 recent extirpations and two suspected extirpations recorded (Table 2). However, it is encouraging to note that the number of extirpations has not increased since the previous (2015) assessment. The most important driver of Lion decline is habitat loss (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2020). Prey base depletion is also a significant driver and is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and the bushmeat trade (Becker <em>et al. </em>2013). Human–Lion conflict, which results in the indiscriminate killing of lions in defence of human life and livestock, is another major threat to the species (Sibanda <em>et al.</em> 2021). The trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017,&#160;Mole and Newton 2020, Coals&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022) is an emerging threat. Furthermore, although trophy hunting can contribute positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices of this practice have been recommended (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2019), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2009, Croes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;Rosenblatt <em>et al.</em> 2014, Loveridge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2023). Poorly regulated trophy hunting has been previously highlighted as a threat to lions, however, attempts have been made to mitigate through the implementation of science-based management practices. Populations that are trophy hunted should be effectively monitored to ensure that there are no negative population impacts. The impact of violent extremism in several parts of Lion ranges in Africa (Lhoest <em>et al.</em> 2022) is likely to further drive the declining nature of lions in these regions. The increasing number of lions poached for their body parts in Mozambique (African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023; Mole and Newton 2020) is of concern, but this presently appears to be confined to this region (Coals <em>et al.</em> 2020), however, illegal trade is reported in at least six African countries (see CITES CoP 17 Prop. 4).<br/><br/>Given the evidence of ongoing and increasing threats to lions across much of their fragmented range, we recommend that the Lion is a species under observation and its threat status is closely monitored, with a reassessment after a minimum three-year period or as soon as new information emerges.<br/><br/>This decline in both population and range, which is likely to continue, reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge. This meets the requirements for listing as Vulnerable (A2abcd).","Since 1975 <em>Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica </em>in CITES Appendix I.<br/><br/>In Africa, lions are present in numerous large and well-managed protected areas (Nicolson <em>et al.</em>&#160;in prep., Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018, Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2022), and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa (Nzomo <em>et al.</em> 2020). Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way, lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a, Funston <em>et al</em>. 2023) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). However, these are almost 20 years old and need to be reviewed and potentially updated. By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (IUCN 2006a, b; IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group 2007, 2018; Bauer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lindsey<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).<br/><br/>Key conservation efforts should include effective protected area management including funding (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, 2021;&#160;Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2020; Robson <em>et al.</em> 2022), mitigating anthropogenic causes of mortality such as Lion-human conflict (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2020, Sibanda <em>et al.</em> 2021) and snaring (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013), and reducing or mitigating the negative effects of armed conflict (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2020, Lhoest <em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/>With the Lion currently listed as Critically Endangered in West Africa and with declining populations within the region, urgent conservation action is required to prevent local extinctions of this subspecies within the region.","The African Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara Desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion at elevations of more than 4,000 m asl in the Bale Mountains in Ethiopia and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania; (West and Packer 2013). Although lions drink regularly when water is available, they can obtain their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the Tsama Melon in the Kalahari Desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments.<br/>&#160;<br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Prides can vary in size and up to 30 individuals have been observed in larger ecosystems, although the average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults (Smuts 1976). In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa/Botswana) it was found that the average pride size was 11.3 ± 1.1 individuals for prides in the park; similar in size to other areas (11.8 individuals in Kruger National Park, 12.5 in Etosha National Park (Funston 2011)).<br/><br/>Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km<sup>2</sup> in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266–4,532 km<sup>2</sup> in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001). Across regions, Lion home ranges can also vary significantly. For example, Lion home ranges in Tarangire National Park in Tanzania can range between 52–616 km<sup>2</sup> (Laizer<em> et al. </em>2014). In contrast, in more arid environments such as Etosha National Park, home ranges up to 2,075 km<sup>2</sup> have been recorded (Stander 1991). <br/><br/>Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra, and wildebeest) make up large portions of lion’s prey base (Hayward and Kerley 2005), but lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to rhinos. Out of the five preferred prey species in Southern Africa (Hayward <em>et al. </em>2007), three historically never occurred in West and Central Africa and Giraffe are rare in that region, leaving only Buffalo but even that species is notably smaller there. Instead, medium sized species such as Kob (<em>Kobus kob</em>) are the preferred prey in West and Central Africa (Bodendorfer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Bauer <em>et al. </em>2008, Tumenta <em>et al. </em>2013). Some Lion populations have adapted to specialize in unique prey species within their own environments, such as Elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) in the Chobe (Power and Compion 2009) and in Hwange (Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2006), and Cape Fur Seals (<em>Artocephalus pusillus</em>) on the Skeleton Coast in Namibia (Stander 2019). Lions will also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena, <em>Crocuta Crocuta</em>, and Cheetah, <em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>) from their kills.<br/><br/>In India, Asiatic Lions prefer the most mesic and thick canopy forest vegetation available to them in the dry deciduous forests of Gir (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2009). The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena <em>et al.</em> 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic lion's diet, although the Chital Deer (<em>Axis axis</em>) is the most common prey species. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African Lions: most Gir prides range between two and eleven adult females (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2009).","<strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit (IUCN 2006a) and control (IUCN 2006b) trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). Traditional medicinal practices in Africa and Asia are perceived to be the main uses that Lion body parts and bones are required (Williams<em> et al.</em> 2017). Specific parts such as skin, claws, teeth, and bones are the most in demand parts (Williams<em> et al. </em>2017; African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023). However, other parts such as tails, reproductive parts and internal organs are also harvested (African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023). <br/><br/>While there has historically been some level of illegal trade and use of Lion bones and body parts for traditional medicine, this threat has escalated in recent years and has emerged in several countries within the species range (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2017; Everatt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019; Coals&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, 2022). In Mozambique the targeted poaching of lions and suspected poaching incidences are high, accounting for 74% and 48% of anthropogenic Lion mortalities in Niassa and Limpopo National Park respectively, with evidence of domestic, regional, and international trade of Lion parts and derivatives (Everatt <em>et al</em>. 2019, Mole and Newton 2020). In South Africa, lions within captive facilities are intentionally killed (generally poisoned) for body parts, presumably to sell to international markets.<br/><br/>The increase in the number of lions killed in Mozambique for their parts is of particular concern (African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023) and may cause the Lion subpopulations within the country to decline. However, there is currently little evidence of this threat being a major concern in other areas across their range.","The main threats to lions include continued habitat loss and conversion of safe space. This has led to several subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2008, 2020). Other significant threats include indiscriminate killing (primarily due to retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock), and prey base depletion (Wolf and Ripple 2016). In recent years the targeted poaching for parts (Everatt <em>et al. </em>2019; African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023) and violent extremism/warfare (Lhoest <em>et al. </em>2022) have emerged as significant threats to the species. Furthermore, while trophy hunting has a net positive impact in some areas, it may, at times, contributed to local population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014). In general, there seem to be an increasing number of lions poached through snaring and targeted poaching in many areas across the species range (e.g., the Greater Kruger, Zambeze Delta, Niassa Reserve, Waza National Park, and WAP complex (African Lion Database, unpub. data. 2023)).<br/><strong><br/>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant. Patterson <em>et al. </em>(2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses, amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer, 2003). Generally, economic losses caused by lions are among some of the highest reported in East Africa when compared to other wildlife species (Muriuki <em>et al. </em>2017). Consequently, lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. However, some case studies exist. For example, Hazzah <em>et al.</em> (2014) estimated that on average, 12.5 Lions were killed per year between 2003 and 2008 by residents of Olgulului Group Range in Kenya. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Hazzah <em>et al. </em>2014). For example, Sibanda <em>et al.</em> (2021) studied Lion conflict in three communal areas in northwestern Zimbabwe (~3,306 km<sup>2</sup>) and recorded 46 lions killed between 2008 and 2017. Following the implementation of livestock protection strategies, livestock losses generally decreased, and the number of lions killed per year declined by 41 % (Sibanda <em>et al. </em>2021).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Prey depletion is generally defined as the substantial decline in prey abundance, and its effect on the survival and reproduction of lions is still fairly under-studied (Vinks <em>et al.</em> 2021). Generally, prey depletion reduces an area’s carrying capacity, which therefore reduces Lion density without necessarily reducing their survival rates (Vinks <em>et al.</em> 2021). Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007, van Orsdol 1984). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey<em> et al. </em>2013). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West (Ripple <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is likely that these declines have been even more dramatic since the publication of this study, although precise data is lacking.<br/><br/><strong>Bycatch in snares</strong><br/>Wire snare poaching is widespread throughout much of the species’ range. Snares are generally set in an effort for to capture species for bushmeat, although lions are not commonly targeted. However, lions are often captured in snares intended for other species (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013, Everatt <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bauer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This threat has the potential to result in severe population declines of all large carnivores if not mitigated accordingly. For example, Becker <em>et al.</em> (2013) found that ~11.5% of the adult and subadult lion population and 20% of the adult (&gt;4 years) males within the population were snared at some point (82% were treated and recovered).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>While there has historically been some level of illegal trade and use of Lion bones and body parts for traditional medicine, this threat has escalated in recent years and has emerged in several countries within the species range (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2017, Everatt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019,&#160;Coals&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022). More information on this threat can be found under the Use and Trade section above.<br/><strong><br/>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in several sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land, providing financial resources for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities (Holechek and Valdez 2018). However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male Lion per 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> has been recommended (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey<em> et al.</em> 2013b) to continued survival of lions in these areas. Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2023; Packer <em>et al. </em>2011). Hunter <em>et al. </em>(2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts on wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching, and tolerance of lions outside protected areas.<br/><strong><br/>Violent extremism and warfare</strong><br/>There are often unforeseen and dramatic consequences and severe environmental impacts resulting from violent extremism adjacent to protected areas (Bouley <em>et al</em>. 2018, Lhoest <em>et al</em>. 2022). Several protected areas (e.g., W-Arly-Pendjari complex, Niassa) within Lion range are under pressure from rebel groups or violent extremist organisations. Unsafe areas resulting from such threats, makes conservation action and protected area management challenging. Protected areas which are occupied by such groups generally lack park management, see increased and unmanaged livestock invasion, suffer habitat loss due to increased crop planting and experience increased bushmeat poaching. <br/><br/>This threat needs to be particularly highlighted in the W-Arly-Pendjari complex (Burkina Faso, Niger and Benin). The W-Arly-Pendjari complex has the last remaining stronghold for lions in West and Central Africa. With the WAP being under severe threat from extremist groups in Niger and Burkina Faso, it places significant threat on this vital remaining population of lions. Supporting this claim is the fact that aerial survey reports in W Park in Burkina Faso, which is currently occupied by extremist groups, indicate that the area is devoid of any large mammalian wildlife (Ouindeyama&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, Lhoest <em>et al. </em>2022). While lions may still occur throughout the complex, if the situation in the complex remains unchanged, this population may likely become significantly reduced, if not extinct altogether.<br/><strong><br/>Other</strong><br/>We expect that climate change will likely have a negative impact on the species; however, the extent of this impact is largely unknown. <br/><br/>The lack of sufficient funding to support protected areas with lions poses a significant challenge to their successful conservation (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018). It has been estimated that protected areas with lions require between $1,000 to $2,000/km<sup>2</sup> annually to be managed effectively, yet receive, on average, $200/km<sup>2</sup> annually (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018). Nearly all protected areas in Africa with lions are inadequately funded, with deficits totally $0.9 to $2.1 billion.","<strong>Abundance </strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers. Determining a population number for lions is incredibly challenging as most populations have yet to be surveyed and population numbers that may exist are based on guesses or extrapolations. In addition, some surveys are outdated. For this assessment, to determine a global population number, we used the latest population estimates published in the Guidelines for the Conservation of Lions in Africa (GCLA, Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2018), and where possible, updated those figures from the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group’s African Lion Database (ALD) where more recent surveys have been completed. Caution must be exercised when using these figures and inferring trends based on these data presented in the GCLA due to various data limitations. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative, we decided not to base this assessment on total population numbers. Though our knowledge of the Lion distribution has improved with time, it is still limited at the national, regional, and range-wide scales because reliable data on Lion population trends are missing from large portions of their range, particularly those in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>In this assessment, we estimate the total number of adult and subadult lions to be between 22,000 and 25,000 lions in Africa (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2018; African Lion Database, unpub. data. 2023; Supplementary Information Table S4) and ~670 lions in India (Gujarat Forest Department 2020). However, this estimate should be used with caution as there is significant uncertainty around population estimates. For this assessment, we were unable to estimate the number of mature individuals. This is largely due to the levels of uncertainty in population estimates (see discussion below). In addition, the proportion of mature individuals can differ from one population to the next. This makes estimating the mature population challenging and potentially unreliable. This emphasises the need for standardized means to estimate and report Lion population data.<br/><br/>Between 2006 and 2018, the Lion population in Africa was estimated to have declined by 25% over 12 years from 33,292 to 25,105 (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although in the past decade, Lion subpopulations seem to be increasing in many of their Southern African ranges, there are indications of a general population decline across its total range with the largest assumed declines in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in Southern Africa—especially those in fenced, well-protected reserves. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is sufficiently funded with fencing being one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, di Minin <em>et al. </em>2021). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets insufficient (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018, Robson <em>et al.</em> 2022), leading to local declines and even extinction (e.g., West Africa; Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, and South Sudan, but these are assumed to be declining based on the limited data available from these areas and the conservation challenges in these areas (e.g., political instability).<br/><br/>While lions qualify as Vulnerable, it is of great concern that parts of the African population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the category for Endangered – particularly in West Africa. Since the sample subpopulations were all monitored, an even greater average rate of decline is likely for unmonitored subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation and mitigation effort.<br/><strong><br/>Bayesian Modelling</strong><br/>A Bayesian state space model to estimate the growth rate-λ of each subpopulation was completed following the methods in Bauer <em>et al. </em>(2015). While this model demonstrates strong support for a Vulnerable listing, it cannot be used as a formal method to which we assess the species as this method is not fully consistent with the IUCN Red List Guidelines. <br/><br/>Data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations were used with additional unpublished data provided by contributors (Supplementary Information Table S4). Population estimates were obtained by commonly used scientific research methods including total counts, individual identification, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photographic databases, and density estimates based on direct observations (Supplementary Information Table S5 and S6). Population estimates were excluded for sites based on extrapolation of densities from other areas, or informed estimates by researchers. The minimum number of surveys per site over the assessment period was two, but some sites were monitored more regularly.<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations (or ten years, whatever is longer) as the relevant time span for trend assessment. A Lion generation length of 6.98 years (three generations = 21 years) was used for the modelling (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Subpopulations were first categorized individually and then according to region. The mean of the regional values was used to determine a continental result for Africa and India (Supplementary Information Table S1 and S6). However, because the two continental results were significantly different, their mean could not be used to estimate a global probability of population trend.<br/><br/>To assess population trends a Bayesian hierarchical state space model was used to estimate the growth rate-λ of each population (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015). Fifty-six unweighted posterior density distributions of growth rate (one per population) were summed across three sets to provide geographic conservation-relevant estimates of demographic trends. The four African regions defined by the IUCN regional Lion conservation strategies constituted four sets (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2015). The projected probability of decline over T years by 33% and 50% (see supplementary material for formulas and Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015) for each population was estimated (Supplementary Information Tables S1 and S2) without making inferences on true population size N, with T equal to 7 (one generation), 14 (two generations) and 21 years (three generations).<br/><br/>The summed posterior densities of growth rates for regional groups showed that, the West African populations were sharply declining λ = 0.87 ± 0.25 (Supplementary Information Figure S1), Central African populations were slightly increasing λ = 1.02 ± 0.18 (Supplementary Figure S2) while East African populations were stable λ = 1 ± 0.15 (Supplementary Figure S3). Southern African populations were by contrast, increasing λ = 1.07 ± 0.17 (Supplementary Figure S4).<br/><br/>The models estimated that the West African group had the highest probability of declining by one third in three lion generations of 0.74, followed by the Central African group (0.33), the East African group (0.36) and the Southern African group (0.20; Supporting Information Table 1). At a continental African level, the Lion population has a 41% probability of declining by 33% (one third) within three Lion generations, while we estimate that probability to be 2% in India.<br/><br/>Models estimate the probability of meeting the thresholds for lower or higher categories (Near Threatened or Endangered) is lower than 41% and thus lions do not qualify for these categories. The threshold for Endangered under Criterion A is a 50% population size decline over three generations. The probability of such a decline is estimated to be 72% in West Africa, 29% in Central Africa, 30% in East Africa, 17% in Southern Africa and 2% in India (Table 1). Therefore, only West Africa would qualify as Endangered. The Lion subpopulation in West Africa has been classified as Regionally Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(ii) in 2014 (Henschel <em>et al. </em>2014), which is supported in the current analysis. It is vital that more Lion areas are surveyed rigorously, and that urgent conservation priority should be placed on West Africa. Based on our analysis, lions qualify as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that parts of the African population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the category of Endangered. Since the sample subpopulations were all monitored, an even greater average rate of decline is likely for unmonitored subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort. Finally, trends inferred are from a small proportion of Lion populations, given so few populations are subject to regular surveys; there is therefore a chance that they may not be representative of most populations, for which data is lacking (see Figure S6 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to uncertainty and data limitations</strong><br/>Due to insufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates, they cannot be employed to estimate overall, real-time trends, as such, groupings of scientific time series site estimates have been used as a proxy. Although these data are more numerous for lions than for other big <em>Panthera</em> cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015) and the treatment of it to estimate species population trend.<br/><br/>The difficulties in comparing survey data are recognized. In some cases, survey methods varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies. There is inherent bias when using survey data as these often come from well-monitored areas with some element of protection and limited anthropogenic threat pressure (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Bauer <em>et al. </em>2015). This could bias overall results to a more optimistic state as declining populations do not necessarily have supporting data due to limited monitoring on the ground (See Figure S6 in Supplementary information). For example, the data available for the Burkina Faso component of the W-Arly-Penjari Complex indicates a steady, but slow, increase in population size between 2012 and 2015. However, due to the recent and ongoing violent extremist presence in the area (Lhoest <em>et al.</em> 2022), protected area management is no longer present – offering little protection to species. This is very likely to have resulted in population declines of all wildlife, including lions (as explained in the Threat Section below). However, due to the simple fact that conducting rigorous surveys on the ground is near impossible, population data to support the well-based assumption that this subpopulation is declining are not available. As a result, it is assumed that a more optimistic view on regional trends is presented here (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015). Robust and regular surveys must be carried out in future that promote more reliable assessments of trends.<br/><strong><br/>Fenced Reserves</strong><br/>Another aspect of the assessment that needs to be documented is our treatment of small, fenced reserves in Southern Africa (specifically South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi). Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where management practices include translocations and reintroductions. It must be noted that South African Reserves that have a contracepted population have not been included in our estimates. In South Africa, there are 50 small, fenced reserves that are represented as one subpopulation that we refer to as South Africa’s Managed Metapopulation (J. Selier pers. comm. 2022). Such management decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency, and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2015). Management of lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes and to retain adaptive potential and follows a nationally coordinated meta-population management approach (Mallon and Stanley Price 2013, Hayward&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). It is further recognized that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2013). Thus, these populations are 'lightly managed' as defined in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2022) and that they can therefore be considered ""wild"" and are therefore included in the assessment.<strong><br/></strong>"
