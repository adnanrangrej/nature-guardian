### ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend Services: Lambdas & Cloud Functions
The backend for NatureGuardian is composed of several serverless functions:

| Name                        | Technology        | Purpose                                                                 | Path in Repository                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| NewsNotifierLambda          | Kotlin (AWS)      | Fetches GNews articles & updates DynamoDB (scheduled via EventBridge)   | `/backend/NewsNotifierLambda/`        |
| DeviceRegisterLambda        | Kotlin (AWS)      | Registers devices to an AWS SNS topic for push notifications            | `/backend/DeviceRegisterLambda/`      |
| NewsApiLambda               | Kotlin (AWS)      | Provides an API Gateway endpoint to fetch news from DynamoDB            | `/apigateway/NewsApiLambda/`          |
| CloudinarySignatureFunction | Kotlin (GCP)      | Generates secure signatures for Cloudinary uploads (via Google Cloud Run) | `/cloudinarysignaturegenerator/`      |

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions (For Building from Source)

To build and run the NatureGuardian Android app from source, or to deploy your own backend, you'll need to configure your own cloud resources and API keys.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adnanrangrej/nature-guardian.git
   cd nature-guardian
   ```

2. **Android App Setup (`app/` directory)**:

   a. **Firebase**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new Android project.
   - Register your app with the package name `com.github.adnanrangrej.natureguardian` (or your own if you change it).
   - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `app/` directory of the cloned project.
   - Enable Firebase Authentication (e.g., Email/Password sign-in).
   - Enable Cloud Firestore and set up basic security rules.

   b. **Secrets Configuration (`app/secrets.properties`)**:
   The Android app uses the Secrets Gradle Plugin to manage API keys. Create a file named `secrets.properties` in the `app/` directory with the following keys (replace `YOUR_..._KEY` with your actual values):

   ```properties
   MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_Maps_API_KEY
   BACKEND_BASE_URL=YOUR_DEPLOYED_NEWS_API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT_URL
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   CLOUDINARY_BACKEND_URL=YOUR_DEPLOYED_CLOUDINARY_SIGNATURE_FUNCTION_URL
   CLOUDINARY_BACKEND_URL_API_KEY=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_SIGNATURE_FUNCTION_API_KEY_IF_ANY
   # Note: The GEMINI_API_KEY for the NatureBot is configured in its Python Lambda environment, not here.
   ```

   - `MAPS_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Google Maps SDK for Android.
   - `BACKEND_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your deployed News API Lambda (via API Gateway).
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary account's cloud name.
   - `CLOUDINARY_BACKEND_URL`: The URL of your deployed Cloudinary Signature Generator function (e.g., on Google Cloud Run).
   - `CLOUDINARY_BACKEND_URL_API_KEY`: An API key if you've secured your signature generation endpoint.

   Ensure this `secrets.properties` file is **not** committed to your version control (it should be in `.gitignore`).

   c. **Build the App**:
   Open the project in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, and then build and run on an emulator or device.

3. **Backend Services Setup**:

   For each service in the `backend/`, `apigateway/`, `cloudinarysignaturegenerator/`, and `naturebot/` directories:
   - Navigate into the respective directory.
   - Follow the instructions in its `README.md` file for setup, configuration (including API keys like `GEMINI_API_KEY` for `naturebot`), and deployment to AWS or Google Cloud.
   - You will need to set up:
     - **AWS**: DynamoDB table (for news), SNS topic (for notifications), API Gateway endpoints, IAM roles, and an EventBridge rule (e.g., 15-minute schedule for `NewsNotifierLambda`).
     - **Google Cloud**: A Cloud Run service for the Cloudinary signature generator (secure it appropriately).
     - **Cloudinary**: A Cloudinary account.
     - **Google Gemini**: An API key for the NatureBot.

## üìÇ Detailed Backend READMEs

For specific setup, deployment, and configuration of individual backend services, please refer to their dedicated README files:

- `backend/README.md`
- `apigateway/README.md`
- `cloudinarysignaturegenerator/README.md`
- `naturebot/README.md`

---

## üôã Known Limitations & Considerations

- **Demo APK Signing**: The provided demo APK is signed with a temporary demonstration key, not a production Play Store key.
- **Backend Costs**: Deploying the backend services will require accounts with AWS and Google Cloud, which may incur costs based on usage.
- **Educational Focus**: This project is primarily for educational and demonstration purposes. While comprehensive, it may not cover all production-level hardening or optimization aspects.
- **API Key Security**: Always handle your API keys and cloud credentials securely. Do not commit them to your repository.
